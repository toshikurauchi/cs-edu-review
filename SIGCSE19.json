Exploring the interplay of technology, education, and inclusion over the past 50 years, Dr. Hrabowski examines what this means for our future work in higher education. Computing education provides a critically important case. As the sector evolves rapidly, many well-paid jobs go unfilled and we must explore ways to draw on talent wherever it is found. Emphasizing themes from his TED talk on student success, Dr. Hrabowski focuses our attention on the importance of high expectations and hard work, building community among students, faculty engagement with students, and rigorous assessment of what works. He assesses the way innovative approaches - including course re-design, active and experiential learning, research, and partnerships with companies and agencies - promote student success, inclusive excellence, and achievement for all students both in STEM generally and computer science in particular.", "authors": [{"name": "Freeman A.

We argue that, for substantial coverage of big data and cloud computing concepts and skills, the relevant topics need to be integrated into multiple core courses across the undergraduate CS curriculum rather than creating additional standalone core or elective courses and performing a major overhaul of the curriculum. Our approach to including these topics is to develop autonomous learning modules for specific core courses in which their coverage might find an appropriate context. In this paper, three such modules are discussed and our classroom experiences during these interventions are documented.

However, relatively little work has been done to investigate the interaction of group work and non-programming exercises because collaborative, non-programming work is usually open-ended and requires analysis of unstructured, natural language responses. In this paper, we consider collaborative, non-programming work consisting of online wiki text from 236 groups in nine different CS1 and higher-level courses at a large Midwestern university. Our investigation uses analysis tools with natural language processing (NLP) and statistical analysis components. First, NLP uses IBM Watson Personality Insights to automatically convert students' collaborative wiki text into a Big Five model. This model is useful as a quality metric on group work since Big Five factors such as Openness and Conscientiousness are strongly related to both academic performance and learning. Then, statistical analysis generates regression models on group size and each Big Five trait that make up the factors. Our results show that increasing group size has a significant impact on collaborative, non-programming work in CS1 courses, but not for such work in higher-level courses. Furthermore, increasing group size can have either a positive or negative impact on the Big Five traits.

Naturally, a positive team experience yields better results than a negative experience.

Previous research has found that social sensitivity influences the amount of communication and the ultimate performance of traditional face-to-face teams. However, virtual teamwork is becoming more common. Does social sensitivity have a similar influence in virtual teams? Virtual teams have different interactions than face-to-face teams because they use communication technologies, which can hinder certain human cognitive processes. Our current research focuses on the influence of social sensitivity on the amount of communication and the performance of students who work as a virtual team using text-based communication in Discord.

Studies have shown experiential educational activities, like conferences, encourage students' persistence in STEM; this is especially important for students underrepresented in the field, who are more likely than their well-represented peers to leave their degree programs. In recent years, academic literature has pointed to anecdotal evidence that conference participation for students early in their undergraduate education relates to students' persistence in STEM pathways. Using national survey data, we examine the relationship between conference participation and first and second year undergraduate students' persistence in computer science pathways. This paper presents results from a cross-sectional analysis and a two time-point analysis of national survey data collected from undergraduate students. Overall, we found that first and second year computing majors who attended a technical computing conference reported higher levels of belonging to their field and confidence to persist in their degree program than those who did not attend. We also found that conference participants' levels of belonging and self-confidence is higher than non-participants over time, even after controlling for initial levels at Time 1. Our analyses also showed that conference participation was associated with closing the gap in levels of belonging and self-confidence between students who are underrepresented in computing and those who are well-represented.

The goal of this paper is to enable wider use of such exercises through large-scale automated generation of short, multiple-choice mental execution questions. The challenge in automation is to algorithmically generate effective distractors (plausible, but incorrect choices), and to generate questions of varying levels of difficulty and whose difficulty level can be set by the instructor. In this paper, we propose a language-generalizable approach for automatically generating a practically unlimited number of such exercises, each constructed to a designated level of difficulty and incorporating the core programming-in-the-small themes: assignment, conditionals, loops, and arrays. The stochastic tree-based generation algorithm and a subsequent simulation of execution also enable generating effective distractors since all possible execution paths are readily available in the tree at the time of generation, and the distractors, therefore, correspond to reasonable (but ultimately incorrect) paths of execution. Furthermore, the approach is easily transferable to other languages with little effort.

These systems have historically graded assignments through either a jailed sandbox environment or within a virtual machine (VM). For a VM, each submission is given its own instantiation of a guest operating system and virtual hardware that runs atop the host system, preventing anything that runs within the VM communicating with any other VM or the host. However, using these VMs are costly in terms of system resources, making it less than ideal for running student submissions given reasonable, limited resources. Jailed sandboxes, on the other hand, run on the host itself, thus taking up minimal resources, and utilize a security model that restricts the process to specified directories on the system. However, due to running on the host machine, the approach suffers as new courses utilize autograding and bring their own set of potentially conflicting requirements for programming languages and system packages. Over the past several years, \\em containers have seen growing popularity in usage within the software engineering industry as well as within autograding systems. Containers provide similar benefits of isolation as a VM while maintaining similar resource cost to running within a jailed sandbox environment.

They know their code has defects, but finding the problem may be beyond their experience, especially for beginners. An additional concern is balancing the need to provide enough direction to be useful, without giving the student so much direction that you effectively give them the answer. This paper presents our experience using heat maps to visually guide student attention to parts of their code that are most likely to contain problems. These visualizations are generated using existing tools that capture execution traces from instructor-written tests to identify which portions of the code are executed during tests that pass, and which portions are executed during tests that fail. Superimposing execution footprints allows statistical identification of locations in the student's code that are most likely to contain faults. This paper describes the results of using this feedback approach to help guide student attention with heat map visualizations over two semesters of CS1 involving over 700 students.

Data is based on a series of fifty (50) one-on-one interviews with students, 22 of whom come from a coding bootcamp background and 28 who come from a four-year college.   Alongside these interviews, students completed both pre-surveys (50 students) and post-surveys (19 students) on learning preferences and programmatic experience; 12 students also participated in follow-up interviews further articulating their learning experiences.

Such camps often emphasize fun aspects of computing, such as games and robots. In contrast, research at the collegiate level suggests that meaningful applications of computing, such as computing for social good, are more successful at building and sustaining interest, particularly among students from groups traditionally underrepresented in computing. In this project, we developed and offered a summer camp that draws upon ideas and approaches from the digital humanities (DH), which explore the use of algorithms and computation in support of broader humanistic inquiry. Because DH reveals different ways to apply algorithmic and computational thinking, DH has the potential to attract students who might not otherwise consider computing. In this paper, we introduce central issues in the digital humanities, explain the rationale for the camp design, describe the camp curriculum, and reflect on successful and less successful aspects of the camp.

Furthermore, assessing and teaching the process of writing and executing software tests is also important, as shown by the multiple variants proposed and disseminated by the software engineering community, e.g., test-driven development (TDD) or incremental test-last (ITL). We present a family of novel metrics for assessment of testing practices for increments of software development work, thus allowing early feedback before the software project is finished. Our metrics measure the balance and sequence of effort spent writing software tests in a work increment. We performed an empirical study using our metrics to evaluate the test-writing practices of 157 advanced undergraduate students, and their relationships with project outcomes over multiple projects for a whole semester. We found that projects where more testing effort was spent per work session tended to be more semantically correct and have higher code coverage. The percentage of method-specific testing effort spent before production code did not contribute to semantic correctness, and had a negative relationship with code coverage.

We found that while students reported the strategies to be valuable, many had trouble regulating their choice of strategies, defaulting to ineffective trial and error, even when they knew systematic strategies would be more effective. Students that embraced the debugging strategy completed more features in a game development project, but this association was mediated by other factors, such as reliance on help, strategy self-efficacy, and mastery of the programming language used in the class.

Students used MSPs in ways beneficial to their learning and stress reduction: spending sufficient time, completing more than necessary, preparing for exams, and pivoting to avoid getting stuck.

Therefore, is it possible that by structuring our exams in an easy-to-hard fashion, we are causing students to perceive the test as more difficult than it actually is? Could changing the question order allow us to change students' perception of their own achievement? What effect could this have on actual performance? This paper attempts to answer these questions by randomly assigning students to write exams ordered either easy-to-hard (referred as 'Easy-Difficult') or hard-to-easy ('Difficult-Easy), then ask them to predict their marks on per-question basis. We find that the question ordering has a small but not statistically significant effect on the performance, and virtually no effect on predicted marks when treating the entire class as one unstratified sample.

The partnership recruited over 100 NYC teachers to implement the course, provided professional development (PD) and implementation support, and conducted research on the course implementation and the effects on teachers and students. This paper reports on findings from the implementation of BJC as an AP CSP course in NYC from the 2016-17 school year.

The goal of this approach was twofold: first, to stress the importance of programming language selection as part of a career preparation module; secondly, to improve the overall success and satisfaction of the students. The results of this work led to additional questions, including how students (peers) could be leveraged to act as instructors in laboratory settings to aid in a peer-led learning exercise. One of the unique challenges associated with CS2 curricula is the varying degree of student experiences and expertise when entering the course. Course surveys have demonstrated that a subset of the student population enter the course with significant programming experience, while others report no prior experience with programming or programming languages. It is therefore the role of the instructor, to find the proper balance within the course in order to satisfy all students' learning needs. In the original work it was indicated, via student post-completion surveys, that peer-led discussion of coding \"best practices\" could improve overall student outcomes.

This feedback focuses on functional correctness, and the output, which is often phrased in technical language, may be difficult to for novices to understand or effectively use. Static analyses may be effective as a complementary aid, as they can highlight common errors that may be potential sources of problems. In this paper, we introduce PyTA, a wrapper for pylint that provides custom checks for common novice errors as well as improved messages to help students fix the errors that are found. We report on our experience integrating PyTA into an existing online system used to deliver programming exercises to CS1 students and evaluate it by comparing exercise submissions collected from the integrated system to previously collected data. This analysis demonstrates that, for students who chose to read the PyTA output, we observed a decrease in time to solve errors, occurrences of repeated errors, and submissions to complete a programming problem. This suggests that PyTA, and static analyses in general, may help students identify functional issues in their code not highlighted by compiler feedback and that static analysis output may help students more quickly identify debug their code.", "authors": [{"name": "David Liu", "affiliation": "University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"}, {"name": "Andrew Petersen", "affiliation": "University of Toronto Mississauga, Mississauga, ON, Canada"}], "tags": ["error messages", "errors", "static analysis", "python", "cs1"]}, {"title": "Using GitHub in the Classroom Predicts Student Learning Outcomes and Classroom Experiences: Findings from a Survey of Students and Teachers", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3287460", "abstract": "GitHub is a widely-used software development platform that supports version control, collaborative development, and project hosting. Currently, an estimated 18,000 educators use GitHub in programming classrooms. Depending on how GitHub is implemented in the classroom, students may rely on GitHub for activities such as, submitting assignments, collaborating on group projects, and receiving feedback. Despite GitHub's growing presence in programming classrooms, to date, few studies have explored how GitHub and the design of its implementation shape students' learning outcomes and classroom experiences. Building on previous research, we investigated how students in classrooms that used GitHub (GitHub classrooms), as opposed to classrooms that did not use GitHub (non-GitHub classrooms), differed across key variables. We surveyed 7530 students and 300 educators from GitHub and non-GitHub classrooms. Overall, we found that using GitHub in the classroom predicted better learning outcomes and classroom experiences. For example, students felt more prepared for the future, and they felt a greater sense of belonging in the classroom and in the field. Importantly, the design of implementation affected learning outcomes. For example, of the students who used GitHub in the classroom and received instructor feedback, those who received (versus did not receive) feedback via GitHub benefited more from the feedback. We discuss best practices for maximizing benefits to student learning when implementing GitHub in the classroom, study limitations, and future research directions.

Additionally, in subsequent courses, do students strengthen their knowledge from prerequisite courses and, if they do, does that improvement matter for the subsequent course? This study examines the prerequisite knowledge of 208 students in an upper-division data structures class at a large North American research university. Prerequisite proficiency on entry to the course was surprisingly low, with nearly a third of students demonstrating low proficiency and only a quarter high proficiency. Students modestly improved their proficiency during the term, lifting a third of those with low proficiency to at least medium proficiency. Overall, final exam performance was significantly correlated with prerequisite knowledge. For those with low initial proficiency, improvement in proficiency was significantly correlated with performance on the final.

To avoid \"cascading penalties\" on later questions that build on earlier ones, students could reveal the answer for any question during the exam for a \"reveal penalty\": If the student identified the correct place in the code to copy and paste the revealed answer, they would get 20% of the question points. That is, by simply revealing every answer and copy-pasting it correctly, even the weakest student should be able to achieve 20% of the points for the coding portion of the exam. In this paper, we study how students used this mechanism. Surprisingly, some students chose to take zero points for certain questions rather than revealing the answer, and some who asked for an answer to be revealed were unable to correctly incorporate it to get the question correct. We also find a correlation between student scores on the non-coding multiple-choice section of the exam, which had no hints/reveals available, and the coding section, even though students who performed poorly on the non-coding first half of the exam should have been able to score well on the coding part by using the reveal mechanism.

However, dimensionality tests using factor analysis did not support a five-factor structure; rather, the factor analyses suggested either using one item per subscale or mean composites of the subscales to form a total score of attitudes towards computing.

Tests of criterion validity show that the short-form of the scale, using a mean composite score of either one item per subscale or the composites of the subscales themselves, predict students' computing knowledge and intentions to persist just as well as using the subscales.

Recommendations for improving scales, such as not using reverse-coded items and having a sufficient number of items that differentiate between subscales, are provided.

Further, the concept of CT is often poorly defined, especially as it relates to younger learners. Despite these challenges, teachers are being asked to integrate CT into other content lessons. To understand if and how this is happening, we conducted a statewide survey of primary (early childhood through middle school) Maryland teachers. The survey asked the teachers about their conceptualization of CT, CT resources they rely on, and their comfort levels to provide effective CT instruction for their students. The results of our survey demonstrate that teachers hold diverse views of the concept of CT and use a varied set of instructional resources in their classrooms.

Students learn to use loops by being exposed to a range of loop examples, initially with scalar values and then over composite data such as vectors. When writing a finite loop to iterate over a vector, we can iterate upwards or downwards. In many cases, the order does not change the outcome; however, for some tasks it is important to consider which direction is most suitable before writing a solution. For example, if we want to shift the elements of a vector one position to the right (left), we should choose a downward (upward) loop. However, when we asked undergraduate students to implement the shift right task, most of them used an upward loop. This outcome indicates the students didn't consider the loop direction before coding the iterative task. We hypothesise that this was in part due to course materials favouring upward loops. To confirm this hypothesis, we have analysed the examples presented in our local CS0/CS1 courses as well as four popular MOOCs. This analysis has corroborated an overwhelming bias towards upward loops. We have also found a lack of instruction regarding the possible impact of direction on code efficiency. Thus, in order to improve novice programmers' iteration skills, we propose CS1 examples that expose students to a more balanced mix of up/down loops and the explicit choice of direction.", "authors": [{"name": "Cheryl Pope", "affiliation": "University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia"}, {"name": "Amali Weerasinghe", "affiliation": "University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia"}, {"name": "Cruz Izu", "affiliation": "University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia"}], "tags": ["iteration", "down loops", "novice programmers", "program design"]}, {"title": "Can You Teach Me To Machine Learn?", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3287392", "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become an important topic for students across disciplines to understand because of its useful applications and its societal impacts.

Through ten interviews with instructors of ML courses for non-majors, we inquired about student preconceptions as well as what students find easy or difficult about learning ML. We identified PCK in the form of three preconceptions and five barriers faced by students, and six pedagogical tactics adopted by instructors. The preconceptions were found to concern themselves more with ML's reputation rather than its inner workings. Student barriers included underestimating human decision in ML and conflating human thinking with computer processing. Pedagogical tactics for teaching ML included strategically choosing datasets, walking through problems by hand, and customizing to the domain(s) of students.

First, the course requires significant resources and administering it is significantly more time consuming for instructors than a regular course. Second, students hesitated to treat mastery quizzes as formative. Finally, the flexibility that the course provided, with little structure and few incentives to help students stay on track, led to considerable procrastination. These factors combined to lead students to delay coursework until the end of the semester -- and beyond. As a result, while our data shows an increase in completion relative to the online format, we saw no change in completion relative to the flipped CS1 offering and saw no change in student performance as evaluated by a final exam.

This scale of activity impacts the overall process, and the software systems have required substantial alterations. Throughout, the focus of the submission and review system has remained the same: a fair, peer-reviewed system with a large number of volunteer reviewers, a quick turnaround of all reviews, and ease of use for all the stakeholders - contributors, attendees, reviewers, meta-reviewers, conference leaders, and system administrators.

We analyzed the impact of LESs on students' acquisition of programming concepts, their engagement and usage of SEP-CyLE. The pre and post test results indicated that the assorted LEs have shown a positive impact on student learning across all the institutions. The correlation results demonstrated that there is meaningful relationship between the LEs and the student performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Debra M.

The results indicate students learned the conceptual material in 6 months rather than in the 9 months previously required by the teacher. Students were also able to apply these concepts afterward when programming in Python, implying knowledge transfer. However, student opinions about culture and computing didn't improve, and student engagement was below initial expectations.

To our knowledge, no research has studied student tinkering behaviors while solving problems in block-based programming environments. In this position paper, we propose a definition for tinkering in block-based programming environments as a kind of behavior that students exhibit when testing, exploring, and struggling during problem-solving. We introduce three general categories of tinkering behaviors (test-based, prototype-based, and construction-based tinkering) derived from student data, and use case studies to demonstrate how students exhibited these behaviors in problem-solving. We created the definitions using a mixed-methods research design combining a literature review with data-driven insights from submissions of two open-ended programming assignments in iSnap, a block-based programming environment.

This panel brings together four different experts, with a wide range of experience in regards to computer science education and students with disabilities, in an effort to expand both the national conversation and increase efforts related to including students with disabilities equitably in CS education. In this panel we present a group of CS education community members who represent multiple approaches to accessibility and serving students with disabilities, as well as diverse implementations; peer-to-peer mentoring, initiatives focused on a single subpopulation of students with disabilities, curriculum and platform providers, and district and state-wide solutions. The panelists, and the organizations they represent have a diversity of experiences to share, including current high school students and parents of students with disabilities.", "authors": [{"name": "Shireen Hafeez", "affiliation": "Deaf Kids Code, Lafayette, IN, USA"}, {"name": "Emmanuel Schanzer", "affiliation": "Bootstrap, Alexandria, VA, USA"}, {"name": "Emma Koslow", "affiliation": "Programming Pals, Warren, MA, USA"}, {"name": "Todd Lash", "affiliation": "University of Illinois, Champaign, IL, USA"}, {"name": "Maya Israel", "affiliation": "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}, {"name": "Rebecca Dovi", "affiliation": "CodeVA, Richmond, VA, USA"}], "tags": ["equity", "curriculum development", "professional development", "k12 cs education", "inclusion", "students with disabilities", "csforall", "accessibility"]}, {"title": "Embracing our Future: CS Courses and Curriculum for Non-CS-majors", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3287553", "abstract": "CS majors are certainly not disappearing, but the interest and demand for computing from non-CS majors is a far larger part of our future, as members of CS departments, than those on the disciplinary-major path.

CRC frames these tenets for the specifics of computing education. CRC's tenet that all students are capable of digital innovation should drive teachers' interactions and relationships with students. CRC also requires that teachers be continually reflective about their privilege and constraints and how those are connected with our worldviews.

Such classes may be offered to on-campus students for greater flexibility during busy semesters, or to allow them to continue to make progress toward their degrees during internships or semesters away from campus. This trend intersects with a growing CS for All movement that sees more and more non-computer science majors enrolling in CS classes. As online offerings expand, it is important for us to understand who enrolls in online sections and the reasons for their choices, both to make sure that learning outcomes are similar across different delivery mechanisms, and to take advantage of opportunities to tailor course content to specific audiences. In this analysis, we look at two versions, one online and one traditional, of a CS1 class offered at a major public research university.

Recent media reports of attempted foreign interference in the domestic politics highlights the threat to data security from both within as well as outside the country. Adequate protection of information systems urgently requires a cybersecurity-educated workforce trained using a curriculum that covers the essential skills required for different cybersecurity work roles. The demand for effective cybersecurity education has led to efforts at the national level like the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) framework to guide cybersecurity curriculum design. However, the many-to-may relationships among components of the NICE framework makes it difficult for anyone but experienced cybersecurity experts to design courses or training programs. The much needed rapid expansion of cybersecurity education depends on the ability of educators to understand and reflect in their curriculum frameworks like NICE. This poster presentation describes the design and use of viCyber, an intelligent cybersecurity course design tool, currently under development with support from the National Security Agency. The goal of this tool is to guide inexperienced instructors through the curriculum design process and provide an evaluation of their design with suggestions for possible improvements. viCyber is available as a web-based tool for trial and evaluation by the cybersecurity education community. It is hoped that the dissemination of information through this presentation will help make educators aware of this publicly available web-based tool and elicit valuable feedback from cybersecurity educators.", "authors": [{"name": "Rania Hodhod", "affiliation": "Columbus State University, Columbus, GA, USA"}, {"name": "Shamim Khan", "affiliation": "Columbus State University, Columbus, GA, USA"}, {"name": "Shuangbao Wang", "affiliation": "Columbus State University, Columbus, GA, USA"}], "tags": ["nice framework", "cybersecurity education", "intelligent system", "curriculum design"]}, {"title": "Establishing Computational Thinking as Just Another Tool in the Problem Solving Tool Box", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3293792", "abstract": "Even though the computer science education community has not definitively established exactly what ?Computational Thinking\" entails, most will agree that it is using a computing machine to solve problems.

We already teach other forms of problem solving to all our students including: Mathematical Thinking, Critical Thinking, and Scientific Reasoning. Computational Thinking, as well as engineering and design's Design Thinking, should be equally exposed to all students. It is also important to illuminate that these tools are not used in isolation to solve problems. Perhaps the key to the acceptance of Computational Thinking (as well as Design Thinking) as essential educational tools is to highlight their overlap and interdependence with other problem solving skills. The next generation will need practice with every tool at their disposal to be prepared to solve tomorrow's problems.

Moving industry practitioners into the classroom posed problems that both mirrored and went beyond those posed by the typical adjunct hire. First, accommodations had to be instituted to consider the industry adjunct's work schedule. Second, industry professionals professed a fear of not being able to develop materials and teach effectively. To address these concerns, we set up an administrative structure that paired industry adjuncts with campuses that fit their pedagogical strengths and goals, as well as their logistical needs. Industry adjuncts were assigned campus faulty mentors so that there was a point person with which to communicate other than the chairperson. Both industry adjuncts and faculty attended a two-day workshop focused on pedagogical best practices as well as campus logistics.

In the first assignment, students were asked to implement a line editor using a linked list and in the reflection prompt students were asked to reflect on the use of the assigned data structure and what they would do differently if they could do the assignment again. In this assignment, the dominant reflection was a simple recounting of material taught in class. In 15% of the reflections, students identified an implementation improvement that could be used. In 25% of the reflections, students identified non-technical issues such as time management when reflecting on what they would do differently if they had to do the assignment again. In the second assignment, students were asked to code Google's page-rank algorithm and were allowed to choose a graph implementation. They were asked to reflect on their implementation and what they would do differently if they could do the assignment again. In this assignment, the dominant reflection, ?%, was about the appropriateness of the chosen graph implementation compared to other implementations. In their reflection on what they would do differently, only 12% of the reflections mentioned non-technical issues. This data suggests that giving students an opportunity to decide the implementation approach and providing more specific reflection prompts produces more technical reflections.

Many of the existing curricula have been developed by domain experts who are comfortable with specific and technical terminology, which they expect students to master. However, children are not always comfortable with these terms nor do they understand general concepts like 'coding' in the way that the curriculum designers intend. This is a problem because many researchers use self-report and attitudinal survey instruments with the implicit belief that the students' understanding of the terms and concepts resemble their own. This mismatch may invalidate results. For this project, we report on our modification of a validated survey to measure upper elementary students' attitudes about and perspectives on CS by attempting to understand the appropriate language to use when querying children about these topics. We use an iterative, design-based research approach that is informed by educational and psychological cognitive interview processes. We interviewed two groups (N=64) of upper elementary students on their understanding of computer science concepts and attitudes toward coding. Our findings indicate that 4th and 5th grade students could not explain the terms computer programs nor computer science as we had expected and that they struggled to understand how coding may connect with or support their learning in other domains. These results will help to guide the development of appropriate survey instruments and course materials for K-6 students, which both match their use of broad domain concepts and therefore inform their understanding and improve their outcomes.", "authors": [{"name": "Zarifa Zakaria", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Jessica Vandenberg", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Collin Lynch", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Kristy Elizabeth Boyer", "affiliation": "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}, {"name": "Eric Wiebe", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Jennifer Tsan", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}], "tags": ["computer science attitudes", "elementary school", "survey development"]}, {"title": "Fostering State-level Change In CS Education: The Expanding Computing Education Pathways Alliance", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3293812", "abstract": "Efforts to improve and promote CS education characterized by greater participation of underrepresented groups have taken off sharply in the six years since the Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) NSF alliance was first funded.

The key idea is to collect all of the attempts by all students to a particular problem generated by a particular class and to form them into equivalence classes where two attempts are equivalent if they produce exactly the same values on all of the unit tests. This allows the system to find the most common errors made by that class. The system then generates a variety of different kinds of problems by selecting either one of the most common errors or one of the correct solutions and asking the students to critique it. After a student makes a critique they are shown (a subset of) the critiques of their fellow students and are asked to pick the best one before proceeding to the next problem.

Approaches also tend to focus on kernel-level operations - leaving out the connections to higher levels of the OS (e.g. graphical user interfaces). To connect systems concepts and assignments to students' personal experiences and provide a mechanism to discuss high-level layers of interactive operating systems, we assembled a Linux/Android operating system variant specifically geared to be accessible to students taking introductory systems courses, dubbed \"Reptilian\". Reptilian, available as an Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) image, provides both an Ubuntu-derived user-space and the standard Android GUI user-space. The appliance provides a typical Linux kernel development environment for assignments while facilitating demonstration of connections between layers in a modern operating system. To investigate the impact of the use of Reptilian, we compared questions on student evaluations between two semesters - one using Minix as the target system for student assignments and another using Reptilian. The curricula topics were identical, and both courses were taught by the same instructor.

An examination of the CS PBL/project-based learning (PrBL) literature reveals that step 2, self-directed or self-regulated learning (SRL), is lacking in almost every description of PBL. However, extensive CS research literature explores effective methods of SRL, and these methods revolve around the concept of reflection.

Authentic self-esteem can be understood as a balance between competence (skills) and worthiness (feelings of connectedness and acceptance). Recent research by the poster presenter based on these two factors of self-esteem revealed that female computing student's feelings of worthiness and competence are unbalanced: (1) their feelings of worthiness are lower than their feelings of competence within their computing major; and, (2) the gap is largest among seniors. This gap between competence and worthiness manifests as doubt just at the time that students should be excited about graduation and interviewing for jobs.

A significant amount of research in songbird learning has shown that birds' songs are not coded in the DNA like other behavioral features but learned over time through one-on-one tutoring involving experimentation, error detection and adaptation. Like students, juvenile songbirds use active listening to learn a tutor's song that is repeated multiple times. The songbird first divides the complex song into short syllables and later uses trial and error to match the syllables sequence to the tutor's song. Birds learn more effectively when listening to an adult bird from the same species. We draw a parallel to bird learning in humans by implementing one-on-one peer-based tutoring of first-year students by senior students, who share the same culture. This poster presents a successful ongoing mentoring and tutoring model used at the Computer Systems Technology department of New York City College of Technology (CUNY) for over five years.

In order to provide adequate support to students, we propose learning support strategies for TAs. In practical computer science exercises, TAs mainly advise and answer questions from students. However, it is not clear how TAs could best support students. Therefore, we propose the following learning support three types of strategies: \"Hope\", \"Priority\", \"Motivation\". Futhermore, we researched what learning support from the TA was desired by the students and developed a TA support system that presents learning support strategies. According to each learning support strategy, the classroom's map governs seat colors for each student who is the recipient of advice.

We found that conflicts evolve in four general stages, which may not all be present in each conflict: initiation, escalation, de-escalation, and conclusion. Some conflicts are resolved when the students come to an agreement, others end passively. The analysis revealed that the pairs' conflicts began around disagreements about code, who should have control of the keyboard and mouse, and other interpersonal events. This research indicates that conflicts are a significant concern for young students, and supporting young learners in developing improved collaboration skills is a key direction for CS education research.", "authors": [{"name": "Jessica Vandenberg", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Collin Lynch", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Kristy Elizabeth Boyer", "affiliation": "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}, {"name": "Xiaoting Fu", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Eric Wiebe", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Danielle Boulden", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Jamieka Wilkinson", "affiliation": "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}, {"name": "Jennifer Tsan", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"}], "tags": ["conflict", "collaboration", "pair programming", "elementary school"]}, {"title": "Job Placement Experience of Alumni from a 3-year CS Program", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3293805", "abstract": "Computing educators entice students with information about stable, readily available, and lucrative careers in computing.

The poster will present data collected over two semesters from five sections of three programming-heavy chemistry, engineering and math courses taught at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Student groups were asked to present their homework attempts to the class, their peers were asked to fill out surveys containing Yes/No questions and comments on the attempts, and this feedback was passed on to the presenting students, who were then given time to improve their work before submitting their final versions. Comparison of student performance statistics in exams, between semesters during which the study was implemented and prior semesters, is used as a tool to assess student learning. Results of the study from two semesters have shown that group composition and the type of questions asked in the survey are the two major factors at play. The poster will also discuss the enhanced design of the study during the third and final semester in spring 2019 that will take these results into account.

The majority of existing tools for software plagiarism are closed source, requiring instructors to use them in a prescribed configuration and sending student code to a third-party server for analysis. At the core of this analysis is the need to perform a language-specific tokenization of the input program and then to use \"digital fingerprinting\" on the code to identify significant markers. This has required developers to write their own parser for each supported language, which is time-consuming to create and keep up-to-date, and thus a barrier to creation of these tools. Instead we bootstrap new languages into our plagiarism system by leveraging the \"Language Server Protocol\", an initiative to create open-source parsers and tokenizers for many languages (principally to be used within a range of popular IDEs). In this poster, we present our work on Lichen, the open source plagiarism detection tool that is integrated into the Submitty course management platform we use at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This tool is a pipeline of modules for the specific tasks of tokenizing, fingerprinting, and then comparing the fingerprints for any number of files.

Theoretical computer science is a hard subject to teach at the university level. Many students who enter the computer sciences courses have very little mathematical or theoretical background. For this reason, it is important that students acquire an appreciation of these concepts before they leave the secondary education. In anticipation that these contents would not be included or addressed in the context of a subject of Computer Science, a work in progress educational experience is presented during the 2018-2019 academic year for enhancing the algorithmic curriculum of pre-university computing and mathematical courses. We describe a collection of selected problems, puzzles and riddles from high school mathematics and introductory logic, to be added to the current secondary curriculum. We want to show attendees the use of our educational activities, offering practical aspects that could not be shown through the reading of a paper, so that they can learn to use them in their own classes. The preliminary experimental results show that the students who have undergone this educational experience have obtained a higher motivation that those who have followed the course in its traditional form.

Although these programs have seen some success, schools in areas with lower population density continue to struggle to offer computer science opportunities. These schools face unique challenges due to their low population density, including increasing teaching demands in core subjects, smaller teaching staff, and a smaller pipeline of students, making it difficult to justify offering a course in computer science.

We have obtained two Google CS4HS grants to hold educational computer science workshops with teachers from across the region. These workshops allowed us to work closely with teachers and help them become more comfortable with incorporating computer science into their classrooms, while also helping us to form relationships with both teachers and administrators in a number of districts. Building on these relationships, we are taking the next step of working more closely with individual school districts to form professional learning communities.

A challenge is reconciling open-ended making and non-deterministic learning goals with standards that drive traditional education. In the context of our CS-focused STEM magnet school, we designed two 2nd grade lessons that not only align with grade-level standards and our school's computer science-oriented pedagogy, but also incorporate 3D printing and the philosophy of Makerspaces. The integrated Maker experience serves to scaffold computational thinking practices such as abstraction, modeling, and decomposition, which are essential for long-term success in STEM learning. To bring these aspects together, we created a rubric based on existing evaluation tools. Using this rubric, we evaluated the two lessons with a small sample of participants. Our pilot study shows promise of mastery in standard-related content, evidence of a making mindset, engagement in the activity, innovation in design, and solidarity in working with peers. Aligning state standards with open-ended Maker activities has potential for fostering student growth and engagement in the classroom.

The democratization of media, such as photos and videos, has provided a great variety of options to educate a broad audience on myriad topics. In this poster, we will describe the challenges and successes of using animated videos including its beauty, soundness, and utility as critical elements in establishing a strong CT comprehension while engaging K-12 teachers in a non-threatening way. Using a process of iterative design, we have found ways to integrate CT concepts in six non-CS disciplines in the K-12 curriculum. The teachers who have collaborated with us respond positively that this design approach provides them with a greater comprehension of the CT concepts while giving them exciting instructional activities.

In this work we take inspiration from embodied cognition and describe a new, constructionist curriculum for approaching algorithmic efficiency. In order to help students construct understandings of both sorting algorithms and algorithmic efficiency, we present a curriculum that focuses around participatory simulations (PartSims) where students \"play as\" datapoints and experience sorting algorithms from an entirely different perspective. Instead of first experiencing the usual top-down approach to sorting where datapoints are manipulated by an \"observer,\" each student follows a simple set of rules which, collectively, end in an emergent sorting algorithm. In this way, instead of talking in the abstract about the different pros and cons of sorting algorithms, students have different physical experiences across the different algorithms. With this embodied, grounded experience, students then construct for themselves metrics for comparing the different algorithms by evaluating the differences in their physical experiences.

Our study consisted of five one-on-one interviews where participants were given a set of scope-related problems in Java and Python to solve. We noticed that, despite demonstrating a general understanding of scope, some students became confused about the particular subtypes of scope mentioned previously. Our paper identifies four misconceptions about scope involving parameters, variable declarations, and loop variables: that variable declaration and use are indistinguishable, that where the variable is declared (eg. inside/outside of a method) is not relevant, that passing in a value as a parameter changes the parameter's value globally within the code, and that a loop variable defined to iterate through a for loop is accessible outside of the loop it is declared within. Many of these misconceptions indicate that some participants have an abstract notion about scope that is not equivalent to the programming languages' rules about scope.

Pedagogically, there are several compelling reasons to motivate the adoption of Mob Programming in learning settings . First, the collaboration is well-structured meaning that the interaction between even a large group of students will not descend into chaos. Second, students are assigned to roles, which allows for the differentiation of responsibilities and development of skills in different aspects of solving the problem. Third, the rotation of assigned roles allows students to learn and exhibit multiple competencies as well as appreciate bringing different perspectives to bear on solving the problem.

Despite the growing attention on CT in K-12 CS education, there is lingering confusion on the what and how of CT, and CT's relationship to coding and CS. Education research on disciplinary thinking skills in science and mathematics education can provide guidance for teaching and learning of CT. For example, (a) The shift in emphasis on disciplinary thinking helps focus on deeper conceptual understanding rather than rote learning of knowledge and facts. Hence thinking like a scientist, or mathematician, historian or computer scientist, draws attention to authentic practices of those disciplines. (b) Thinking skills are best taught in context. Therefore, CT should be taught in CS classrooms or integrated into learning of other subjects rather than taught as a separate skill or subject. (c) Even if there is no transfer beyond the context in which they are taught, a focus on thinking skills helps in deeper conceptual learning; (d) Like critical or creative thinking, CT should be integrated into other subjects to enrich learning.

We conducted a pilot study on an introductory C++ programming class that applied mastery learning to optimize practice, used a repository of programming problems to reduce instructor effort, and leveraged unit tests to provide feedback and facilitate grading. The class had a lecture component to introduce programming concepts and a lab component for practice. We used mastery learning to control the number of practice-problems students solved on a topic before moving to a more advanced one. We assumed mastery when students answered three programming problems correctly in a row without help. If they sought help, they had to successfully solve a new set of three problems in a row. We also assumed mastery if they solved ten problems because it should have given them sufficient practice. We observed that experienced students asked fewer questions and quickly progressed across topics, while other students got much-needed help from instructors.

In contrast to other lab assignments, Finch labs are team-based activities that revolve around programming Finch, a programmable robot to do activities like moving, sensing the environment, playing music, etc. Introducing the Finch labs has multiple benefits for the students. It helps better anchor the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, since interacting with the Finch robot is done by instantiating a Finch object and performing method calls on the object. This helps students understand many of the object oriented topics of the course, like object instantiation, method calls, passing arguments to a method and changing the state of an object.

Staffing-up to support the influx of students in this field presents challenges of its own. Hiring and training TAs to allow for quality and personal interactions with students, even as the class sizes grow, is expensive and difficult to maintain. Existing tools provide some automation by focusing mainly on output correctness but often overlook the student's approach to solving a problem. A solution is required in order to provide high-quality personalized feedback to very large numbers of student submissions for open-ended assignments, and in the timeframe that will keep today's instant-feedback-seeking students moving forward and not discouraged. The Sense platform utilizes algorithms from bioinformatics and genomics to identify patterns in student submissions and quickly surface insights about how students solved a problem. This enables the educator to provide rapid, equitable, in-depth feedback to each and every student, regardless of class size, and to use insights gained from this process to optimize their teaching methods and choice of assignments. In our presentation, we will show how our system identifies patterns in student submissions and uses those to generate clusters of students who have approached the problem in a similar way.

OneUp enables instructors to define course activities and create exercise problems for practicing and self-assessment, as well as exams or quizzes for testing particular skills. The platform enables gamifying these practice activities. It is highly configurable and supports tailoring gamification features to meet the vision of the instructor. The gamification related configuration includes the choice of the game elements to be used along with specification of gaming rules for them.

Previous research has shown that pair-programming is very beneficial in software engineering education. However, learning and practicing pair-programming are mostly limited in a class where students can only learn to collaboratively program with another student in controlled or laboratory settings. Although nowadays there exist some collaborative tools, such as CodePilot, Google Colaboratory and Git, they are not specifically pair-programming-oriented. This impedes a pairing's ability to discuss effective strategies in problem solving, to form productive or mutually learning pairs, and to predict pair compatibility. To encourage students in out-class practice of pair-programming, we present a demonstration of a novel web-based software development environment, called CodeBuddy, for remote pair-programming. CodeBuddy provides instructors and students with several features for managing laboratory classes and practicing pair-programming. Examples of CodeBuddy's features include: coding screen mirroring between a pair, output terminal to show compiled results, face-to-face like communication channels (i.e., video calling and instant text messaging), automatic and manual role switching, code quality analysis for monitoring coding students' progress and recommending a pair with targeted pairing goals, implicit code reviews using face detection for tracking a reviewer's engagement, line-by-line code commenting, etc. The demonstration consists of a walkthrough of two use-case scenarios: an instructor assigns a problem-solving task and two students remotely work together in a pair using CodeBuddy on two different workstations to solve it.", "authors": [{"name": "Teerapong Leelanupab", "affiliation": "King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"}, {"name": "Tiwipab Meephruek", "affiliation": "King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"}], "tags": ["agile software development", "software engineering", "remote collaboration and learning", "pair programming"]}]
