Typically, the teaching of the three-phase armature winding in the classroom is used a pure theorem through 2-D or 3-D developed diagram. This paper presents the portable hardware tool for integrating the three-phase armature winding in the classroom. The main components of the proposed portable hardware tool consist of an induction motor, 12 winding coils, an armature winding board, and a mini inverter. It is found that it is cheaper to modify an existing single-phase motor than to build a suitable three-phase induction motor. This paper proposes the method of modifying a single-phase induction motor used in an air conditioner to be a three-phase induction motor. Because of compact size, low weight, low voltage, low current, and reasonable time frame, then it is suitable for a lecturer to carry it and demonstrate the three-phase armature winding in the classroom. This proposed tool makes the teaching and learning of rotating electrical machine a more active by using interactive learning to its real world. The effects of reversing two of three voltage phases and changing their frequencies on rotating electrical machine are also demonstrated. The proposed methods have been successfully integrated into the electric machinery course at Kasetsart University Sriracha Campus.", "authors": [{"name": "P.

The current evaluation utilized qualitative analyses of student ePortfolios to better understand student and faculty perspectives of student outcomes based on interdisciplinary assessments of a cross-discipline design project.

Computer science (CS) is one of the fastest growing disciplines in the world and an emerging critical field for all students to obtain vital skills to be successful in the 21st century. Despite the growing importance of computer science, many university and college programs suffer from low student persistence rates. Disciplinary identity is a theoretical framework that refers to how students see themselves with respect to a discipline and is related to long-term membership in a disciplinary community. The theory has been effectively applied in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) to understand students' success and persistence. This study examines the effects of performance/competence, recognition, interest and sense of belonging on the academic persistence of computer science students. A survey of approximately 1,640 computing students as part of a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project was developed and administered at three metropolitan public institutions. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed to validate the sub-constructs of identity for use in a computing identity model. Then, a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed as a snapshot of the structural relationships for describing and quantifying the impact of the identity sub-constructs on persistence. The results indicated that our model for CS aligns with prior research on disciplinary identity but also adds the importance of sense of belonging. In addition, the findings indicate that students' academic persistence is directly influenced by their interest. A better understanding of these factors may leverage insight into students' academic persistence in computer science/engineering programs as well as a meaningful lens of analysis for further curriculum and extracurricular activities.", "authors": [{"name": "Monique Ross", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Zahra Hazari", "affiliation": "Department of Teaching and Learning, Florida International University, Miami, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ken Christensen", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Michael Georgiopoulos", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Mohsen Taheri", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Deepa Chari", "affiliation": "STEM Transformation Institute, Florida International University, Miami, USA"}, {"name": "Atalie Garcia", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Mark Weiss", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Tiana Solis", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University, Miami, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["reliability", "mathematical model", "load modeling", "computer science", "stem", "engineering profession", "computational modeling"]}, {"title": "Motivating Factors and Barriers for Sustained Use of Audience Response Systems - \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would love to, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time:(\u00e2\u20ac\u009d", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658381", "abstract": "Audience Response System (ARS) usage in lectures has grown in the higher education sector over the past decade with the evolution from hardware \u201cclickers\u201d to web and mobile-based systems due to the ubiquity of mobile internet and mobile computing devices.

In this study, we used a person-centered approach to analyze how students can be categorized in terms of their goals in the context of an Introduction to Signals and Systems course. To conceptualize student goals, we expanded existing frameworks to include approach/avoidance, mastery/performance, and task/self/other dimensions. Through cluster analysis, we identified two types of students: (1) students all of whose goals are strong and (2) students whose task- and self-related, but not other-related, goals are strong. Further, we conducted a follow-up analysis to examine potential differences between the two clusters in achievement, effort, and persistence. Results showed that students in Cluster 2 scored higher on some achievement measures than students in Cluster 1.

Motivation and engagement are usually singled out as reasons for students' retention or success, but we found a lack of standards in studies on motivation of computing students, and we have not found literature reviews about this subject. We identified twenty-nine (29) motivation factors presented in 32 selected studies. We divided the factors into five categories: student, professor/teaching, program/course/content, environment/university, and social aspects. The most mentioned factor was related to the teaching-learning strategies (37.5%), professor-student interaction (31.3%) and prior knowledge (31.3%). We also have identified that there is no convergence on literature about the identification and measurement of motivation and engagement. Another interesting aspect was that, despite the literature saying that intrinsic motivation has a greater impact on the student's results, many studies are being carried out considering extrinsic aspects. This shows the concern of the computing community regarding these aspects.

The benefits of agile methods compared to process-heavy models include the ability to respond faster to the changing needs of customers and the short feedback loop between customers and developers. Since agile methods depend significantly on the competence of the individual, teaching traditional approaches (e.g. waterfall) can be advantageous to the understanding of students about what the major activities associated with software development are, by providing a well-defined structure that naturally aligns with the novice student. Towards this goal, we conducted a survey with different types of software engineers, ranging from novice undergraduates to software engineering professionals. The survey provides data on the exposure of traditional and agile process, the level of experience in using traditional and agile process models, and the perceived most optimal learning sequence. Based on the analysis of the collected data, we argue that teaching traditional software engineering process-oriented approaches prior to introducing agile methods, is highly beneficial to students' understanding and optimal use of agile techniques.", "authors": [{"name": "Massood Towhidnejad", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical, Computer, Software & Systems Engineering, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, 32114, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Omar Ochoa", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical, Computer, Software & Systems Engineering, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, 32114, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Miralda Rodney", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical, Computer, Software & Systems Engineering, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL, 32114, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Salamah Salamah", "affiliation": "Department Computer Science, Univeristy of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, 79968, USA"}], "tags": ["software", "modeling", "testing", "knowledge engineering", "agile software development", "software engineering", "education"]}, {"title": "Predicting Student Success in Computer Science \u00e2\u20ac\u201c A Reproducibility Study", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658429", "abstract": "A recent study conducted at the University of Oklahoma, a large research university attempted to use the grades on initial Computer Science courses to predict the success of Computer Science majors.

Research based learning, project based lab courses, problem based learning, feedback systems, flipped classroom, blended learning and gamification in lectures are only some examples for new formats. Common goal of all these new types of learning formats is to increasing students' motivation and to enhance learning success. In this paper, evaluations using a questionnaire with open questions were done among first year students, bachelor students before graduation and alumni, about their sources of motivation and demotivation. Interesting curricula and lectures with application related topics and possibilities for own work are the main sources of motivation. Enthusiastic professors with high competences and good lecture didactics also contribute to students' motivation. On the other side, demotivated professors with boring lectures play a much higher role for demotivating students. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate aspects of student motivation into curriculum and lecture design and professors should become aware that they are important role-models for motivating or demotivating students.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Fuhrmann", "affiliation": "Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule Regensburg Seybothstr. 2, Regensburg, 93053, Germany"}], "tags": ["social networking (online)", "information technology", "psychology", "urban areas", "task analysis", "computational modeling", "electrical engineering"]}, {"title": "A Framework to Foster Diversity in Collaborative Activities", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658438", "abstract": "Dynamic lectures are collaborative settings in which learners and educators interact with each other and among them to produce, learn, and consolidate knowledge. To take part into collaborative settings, individuals must be able to communicate with others, be aware of the artifacts used and of the objects of interest, among others. On their foundation, these requirements depend on motor and cognitive-related abilities such as arm movement, perception, recognition, and memorization. Impairments may influence these abilities and consequently pose challenges to the participation in collaborative settings. To the best of our knowledge, there is not a guide, a method nor a framework to orient anyone who wants to analyze the scenario of collaborative settings in order to create conditions for the inclusion of individual in such activities. In this context, this paper presents the Colab4All - Collaboration for All, a framework created to support the analysis of collaborative settings involving people with impairments. The framework uses the well known Human Processor Model with two complementary objectives: first, to derive questions that must be asked to support the analysis previously mentioned, and then to combine these questions with a collaboration model in order to establish the way potential challenges can be addressed. In order to test the proposed framework, we used it to orient a research on the inclusion of individuals with blindness in a class activity based on graphical notations. The results of such research were tested in a real setting and presented promising results.

Engineering has maintained a stable profile (i.e., white, masculine, and male) for many years, despite national trends in higher education. Multiple researchers have demonstrated that increased diversity leads to improved communication skills, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities, all goals that directly align with engineering's core values. The lack of diversity within engineering has resulted in a culture which produces engineers that are underprepared and lacking the skills required to work in an increasingly diverse and global engineering market. Engineering's cultural attitude towards diversity has created environments where students, especially underrepresented minorities (URM), feel that they do not belong despite meeting the academic requirements. To better understand feelings of belongingness within engineering education, the research team set out to answer the question: How do feelings of belongingness differ across demographic characteristics for new (second week) engineering students, enrolled in a first-year first-semester engineering course? Our results demonstrate that neither disability status, race or sexual identity significantly affect how new engineers report their perception of belonging. Female students entered engineering feeling that they belong but at a level significantly lower than their male peers.

Embodied pedagogical agents are particularly useful in teaching young learners because of the engagement, and enjoyment they engender. Teaching robots are among possibilities in the future classroom; they may also represent solutions to the looming, acute global teacher scarcity. However, their design creates unique computational challenges. Moreover, robot-human systems involving a single robot in interaction with multiple humans, are not common. PI has been reported in many studies as a learner-centered approach that supports conceptual learning, metacognition, cognitive load sharing, and higher order learning, through peer scaffolding. However, existing studies have reported only applications by human teachers in regular classrooms. This study highlights an approach for enabling a PERT as a PI facilitator. Based on conflicting reports of the significance of agent embodiment for learning, we present the report of two experimental studies from our assessment of the system, employing the mixed method approach. We compared participants' perception of the robot's social presence and teaching quality when the robot is physically present and when it is absent (voice-only). Our findings are based on data from 14 participants in each study. The Social Presence indeX (SPiX) and the teacher quality index (TQI) were used for quantitative data collection for social presence and teaching quality, respectively. Qualitative data were based on live observation and participants' open-ended feedback. Quantitative findings show no significant difference in participants' perceptions in both conditions but qualitative feedback provided more information. Our findings show: i) students are willing to accept non-human teachers, and ii) their expectations of them are similar to those for human teachers; iii) an improved affective system will promote increased presence; iv) participants noted the robot as `neutral', with important implications for culturally-responsive education; v) robot teachers could be potential technology-inspired solution to global teacher scarcity and vi) in addition to promoting deeper learning, PI can be a useful pedagogical approach for non-human teachers.

The DCI was offered for very modest course extra credit at the beginning and end of an introductory dynamics course at a large, research-intensive public university. This represents the low-stakes evaluation. By contrast, a midterm examination administered 12 weeks into the 15 week semester included: 1) a set of short-answer concept questions related to the concepts covered by the DCI and 2) two traditional long-answer problem-solving questions. This midterm examination represents the culmination of student understanding of rigid body dynamics, which is primarily what the DCI covers. It also represents the high-stakes evaluation as this examination strongly influences the students' final grade in the class.

Agile project management encompasses several skills including leadership, communication, organization, conflict management, and the ability to navigate ambiguity. While this skill set is common in many industries, it is very uncommon in higher education. By infusing this diverse way of thinking into transformational efforts aimed at enhancing the student experience, we have disrupted the traditional academic hierarchy, seen greater momentum and greater initial success, and created a new model for \u201cgetting things done\u201d in academic organizations.As part of the REvolutionizing engineering and computer science Departments (RED) grant, we aim to improve the culture in the ES. To accomplish this, we have formed grassroots teams consisting of faculty, staff, and students that launch experiments aimed at improving students' professional skills development & departmental culture. This effort has consisted of ~50 participants across 12 teams for three semesters. We did not initially foresee the level of oversight & management needed to run such an effort or the bureaucratic barriers to operationalizing the grassroots teams and experiments. In response to this environment, agile project management was introduced half-way through the first set of experiments. Through observations, surveys, interviews, and outcomes of the experiments themselves, we have characterized the impact of adding agile project management to this program.Our early results indicate that progress can be expedited by an agile project management skill set, and more specifically, the number of experiments launched through grassroots efforts has increased by a factor of 7 semester-over-semester after adding agile project management. Additionally, 92% of participants reported being satisfied with the experience with an average rating of 4 out of 5. Lastly, the value that project managers add was a key theme cited in end-of-semester surveys and interviews. Our early success metrics suggest that this critical industry skill set, generally lacking in academic settings, can make a significant difference in the success of departmental initiatives.

It expands the scope of traditional peer learning beyond the usual classroom setting and motivates student creativity leading to interests in co-curricular professional development. This nifty peer learning model connects computing students from an upper level class with students of a lower level class, so that they can aid each other in a mentor-mentee relationship to address conceptual learning gaps. Existing literature on computing educational research show that several peer learning models have been used in a typical classroom setting for reinforcing learning. However, very few peer learning models have been used in an inter-class setting, and none have been driven by student conceptual gaps in order to create an enhanced learning environment. Our model focuses on developing student interests in further co-curricular professional development opportunities in the form of peer mentoring, tutoring and instruction. Currently, student retention is a significant challenge for computing educators, given the demand of the computing disciplines for an all-round solid knowledge base, including grasping of complex technical concepts. Our approach of inter-class peer collaboration strengthens the learning environment of both lower level and upper level computing courses, and provides much needed support to students, whose knowledge base is still underdeveloped and conceptual understanding is undercooked. This unique form of inter-class peer learning provides upper level students with an exclusive opportunity to reinforce their conceptual grasps by mentoring lower level students. It also enables the lower level students to receive peer guidance for addressing their conceptual gaps. Our improvised peer networking model adds a different dimension to the practice of intra-class peer learning and extends peer learning beyond the traditional bounds. It promotes a new kind of service learning project in classes by encouraging peer mentoring that leads to peer connections across classes. It aids student retention by helping lower level student mentees get over their knowledge limitations. Our work-in-progress research case study indicates that this model inspires peer mentors to engage in out-of-box thinking by challenging them to find creative ways for overcoming conceptual shortcomings of mentees. This, in turn, generates student interests in enhanced co-curricular professional development. Additionally, our ongoing experimental study results show that this model can help in producing a sustainable pool of peer mentors, tutors and teaching assistants, who can become resources plus role-models for other students, and for helping student retention. As part of our in-progress experiments, this model has been deployed within our computer programming classes, where CS2 students have been paired with CS1 students based upon conceptual gaps and knowledge shortcomings. As we conduct these teaching experiments, we analyze the performance of our model through data obtained by conducting student surveys.

However, useful knowledge is hidden in the qualitative comments, in the form of sentiments and suggestions that can provide valuable insights to help plan improvements in the course content and delivery. In order to efficiently gather, analyse and provide deeper insights from student feedback by topics, we developed a user-friendly application, Student Feedback Analysis Tool (SUFAT). The tool is an independent desktop application that can be installed and used by any nontechnical user. The tool takes an excel sheet with comments as an input and generates an excel sheet with visual reports of summaries that include sentiments and suggestions as an output.

Engineering disciplines use technology and engineers deal with computing machines to perform day to day activities. The engineers who use such technologies have to be informed users of technology and also are expected to aid in the advancement of technology. Engineers must have sufficient computer skills. An engineering curriculum must help students acquire these skill sets. Employers note that except for a few, most engineering graduates struggle with learning new technologies and putting them to practice. Computer science students who are technically strong are not getting enough exposure to interdisciplinary projects within their curriculum. Computer science students often note not having enough experience working with diverse problem sets inside their curriculum, which is a key for being successful in any industry after graduation. This paper is about introducing an interdisciplinary course across engineering and computer science disciplines that aims at fixing the above two deficiencies. The course is designed for freshman and will enroll students from computer science and engineering disciplines. The curriculum design will aim at teaching computing concepts with interdisciplinary engineering problem sets. This approach is a unique effort as the objectives of the course are completely different from the typical courses offered within the computer science and engineering disciplines. This course will focus on teaching basic computing skills, basic programming, implementing solutions to interdisciplinary problems sets, choice and use of software tools that aid problem solving, and effectively working across interdisciplinary teams. Designing instructional materials and assessment tools to develop this unique mix of skill sets will be addressed in this paper.

Automatically lifted test performance data are then decomposed into student competencies in the related concepts required to correctly answer the test questions. Simple constrained linear optimization is deployed to find the optimal student competencies in the related concepts such that their linear combination best reconstructs the achieved test scores.

With a philosophical perspective and a critical view of education that connects engineering education to the liberal arts, the group has been moving forward to make an impact in the engineering education community. The goal of the group via all of the collective efforts, discussions, papers, articles, special reports, publications, special sessions, and workshops has been focused on providing a new forum and platform for discussions, debate and dialogue in advocating public awareness of technological and engineering literacy. As an ASEE Division, TELPhE has grown in attracting and engaging practitioners of engineering education, technological and engineering literacy, and philosophy in an ongoing examination of engineering philosophy, the scope of engineering education, and the impact of engineering and technology. Thus far the group has evolved organically but now seeks a theoretical framework to inform strategic planning and goal setting.

Large academic computer labs stocked with high performance computing workstations have long been a major feature of Electrical and Computer Engineering programs. Historically they have been used throughout the curriculum for everything from running complex image processing algorithms in Matlab to simulating and synthesizing advanced digital designs with CAD tools like Vivado. As the cost of computation has declined, however, and as students increasingly bring their own high performance computing devices to the lab, it is no longer clear that workstation-based computer labs provide a significant benefit for student learning. This paper explores this topic by looking at student in-lab computer usage patterns and preferences for an introductory digital design course at California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo.

This initiative, which seeks to simultaneously achieve both pedagogical and organizational change, is built upon a foundation of educational innovation through engaged teaching practices. To sustain educational innovation in CCI beyond the funded scope of the project, pedagogical change is thus strategically embedded in CCI's organizational structure through a 3-stage model of faculty adoption, redesigned student course evaluations, and realigned values in the reappointment, promotion, and tenure process. By recognizing that sustained organizational change takes root when there is concurrent buy-in from organizational members-both bottom-up and top-down- this reform initiative seeks to embed two-pronged change not only via educational innovation (pedagogical change), but also in the day-to-day practices, policies, and physical environment of the College itself (organizational change).", "authors": [{"name": "Bojan Cukic", "affiliation": "College of Computing and Informatics, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC\u00a0"}, {"name": "Lawrence Mays", "affiliation": "College of Computing and Informatics, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC\u00a0"}, {"name": "Daniel J.

These findings support the need for research on the underrepresented engineering technology student population.There is a great deal of diversity research in engineering, and some of the other fields often associated with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). However, this is not the case with the student population in engineering technology. Studies on engineering technology students often focus on students in the majority, which proves to be white male students. This results in the lack of focus and understanding of whom the underrepresented students are and their formal and informal learning influences. Learning in the formal and informal community and family environments have been shown by research to support and influence student choices as well as their future success. Thus, the influence of the underrepresented engineering technology student's past and current environments is significant but relatively unknown.Researchers intended to gather data from underrepresented engineering technology student populations with a survey they developed. The survey queries student demographics, community and school support and preparation for the university experience, as well as their plans for the future.

The guiding hypothesis is that experiences that contribute to engineering identity, which focus on the development of technical mastery, conflict with the development of leadership self-concept. This work presents preliminary analysis of the differences between engineering undergraduates and their peers with regard to their leadership experiences during college. Preliminary results reveal a complex picture of the differences between engineering students and their peers in other STEM and non-STEM fields. Engineering students have the highest leadership self-efficacy of all three groups by the end of the fourth year of college, which mirrors differences in self-rated leadership skills at college entry. However, differences in leadership experiences during college vary among these three groups, and not consistently with their leadership self-efficacy. Engineers are least likely to participate in a leadership training during college and to value becoming a leader after college.

When OO programming is introduced to students, its fundamental concepts are difficult for them to learn at first, and also impact them when they start to design their custom class templates. The existing UML (Unified Modeling Language) based tools could be served for educational purpose, but they are not suitable for novice Java students or programmers. Those tools generate class template code automatically from UML diagrams which must represent the class structures and functionalities clearly. That requires users to have a comprehensive view on the class structures. However, when they are first exposed to custom class design, novice programmers usually do not know what are necessary in the design and/or the relationships among classes if there are any. Therefore, it would be hard for them to develop UML diagrams which could represent class templates clearly. A tool that could help students in this stage is necessary. The jCAB tool introduced in this paper is designed for Java CS1 course, and is a good start for novice programmers to learn how to implement custom classes. The tool divides the custom class design procedure into several steps in order to show students what are necessary in the class design clearly and how to do them in detail. Its GUI (Graphic User Interface) interacts with students, directs them step by step, and generates code in each step automatically, so that students will be aware of the class structure, the design procedures, and how each piece of code is related with OO concept, and they will have better grasp on the OO fundamentals and the custom class design procedures.", "authors": [{"name": "Qian Liu", "affiliation": "Mathematics and Computer Science Department, Rhode Island College, Providence, RI, 02908"}], "tags": ["programming", "java", "unified modeling language", "tools", "gettering", "graphical user interfaces"]}, {"title": "Multi-Dimension Training Scheme to Improve the Innovation Capacity of Postgraduate and Undergraduate Students Collaboratively", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658508", "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper presents a multi-dimension training scheme to improve the innovation capacity of postgraduate and undergraduate students collaboratively.

Throughout this paper a modular and adaptive course is presented, the main objective of which is to make known simple and economic tools of educational robotics. This course is aimed at those who want to discover the possibilities of educational robotics in the context of the introduction to robotics. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. The course is designed to work with the Scratch, Crumble and Arduino tools as STEM enhancers. Using Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programmed. Scratch helps young people to acquire and improve skills such as think creatively, think systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group. It is offered free of charge. On the other hand, Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language based on Scratch that makes it easy for children from 10 years old to use it. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. Last, but not least, Arduino is an open source electronic platform based on hardware and software that is easy to use. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded on the board. The course offers a three-tiered journey through three levels with each of the three tools. It consists of a total of 9 modules. This course has a very practical approach. A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results.

And all this in a global higher education environment, where well-established institutions are in the cross pressure of neoliberal worldview and the humboldtian ideal of the community of scholars [neoliberal].

A systematic review to map the use of Requirements Engineering in the development of AR scenarios pointed to a gap regarding the requirements elicitation process for AR, which led us to think of a teaching strategy to help undergraduate students to specify AR scenario requirements.

These experimental tests verified the strategy, and the results indicate if it is possible to help the students in the elicitation of requirements for AR scenarios from this approach..", "authors": [{"name": "Eduardo Filgueiras Damasceno", "affiliation": "Programa de P\u00f3s Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Inform\u00e1tica-Laborat\u00f3rio de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade Tecnol\u00f3gica Federal do Paran\u00e1, Corn\u00e9lio Proc\u00f3pio, PR, Brasil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Alexandre L'Erario", "affiliation": "Programa de P\u00f3s Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Inform\u00e1tica -Laborat\u00f3rio deInova\u00e7\u00e3o \u2013 Universidade Tecnol\u00f3gica Federal do Paran\u00e1Corn\u00e9lio Proc\u00f3pio \u2013 PR \u2013 Brasil"}, {"name": "Eduarda Maganha de Almeida", "affiliation": "Programa de P\u00f3s Gradua\u00e7\u00e3o em Inform\u00e1tica-Laborat\u00f3rio de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade Tecnol\u00f3gica Federal do Paran\u00e1, Corn\u00e9lio Proc\u00f3pio, PR, Brasil\u00a0"}], "tags": ["software", "virtual environments", "systematics", "augmented reality", "requirements engineering", "software engineering", "education"]}, {"title": "Best Practices Developed by the Model Institute for Excellence from Puerto Rico", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658530", "abstract": "In this paper we present two programs for underrepresented Spanish minorities: Model Institute for Excellence (MIE) and Broader Participation in Computing-Alliance (BPC-A).

Detecting plagiarism manually is a difficult and time-consuming work. In the last two decades, various of plagiarism detection tools have been developed. These techniques could be mainly divided into the following categories: Textual Match, Program Dependence Graph Comparison, Abstract Syntax Tree Analysis and Low-Level Form Code Comparison. Although there had been a lot of researches on detecting code clones in software programming languages (e.g. Basic, C/C++, Java, Python, etc.), research that focused on hardware description languages is still lacking. Based on the effective of the locality sensitive hash function (simhash), which was usually used in detecting near duplicates for web crawling, we proposed an improved real-time plagiarism detection approach for Verilog HDL (hardware description language) programming assignments. The core detecting steps are extracting weighted tokens from source code as high-dimensional feature, and mapping it to a f-bit fingerprints with simhash technique. On account of the syntax characteristics of Verilog HDL, a token extraction strategy was designed to maximize the valid information that a fixed length hash value could represent. Experiments over real course data sets were conducted to evaluate the performance of token-based approach comparing with an existing plagiarism detection tool (Moss). The result shows that our token-based approach does qualify the plagiarism detecting job for both online-query and batch-query in digital designs. Furthermore, token-based plagiarism detection approach could enable conduct incremental plagiarism detection for a single submission without excessive overhead.

The department applied a Concept Inventory test to 195 students from the second semester of 2017 in order to check if there was a correlation between the grades obtained in the class examinations and the performance in a conceptual test of Statics. The Concept Inventory was applied one week before the final examination and it was held inside the University facilities. The students were monitored all the time.

The results show that almost all the students with the highest grades in the class performed above the mean in the Concept Inventory. The overall mean for the conceptual test was 9.27 and the standard deviation was 5.28. The course grades were discriminated by career and an Analysis of Variance was conducted to determine if there were significant differences among the groups. A correlation analysis suggests that there is not a strong correlation between the course grades and the concept inventory results. One possible explanation for this can be due to the fact that the regular teaching method for these kind of basic courses in engineering in the University is merely procedural and problem-solving oriented, conceptual approaches are often neglected in both teaching and assessment.", "authors": [{"name": "Jaime Leonardo Barbosa Perez", "affiliation": "Deparment of Mechanical Engineering, Eafit University, Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jorge Luis Restrepo Ochoa", "affiliation": "Deparment of Mechanical Engineering, Eafit University, Medell\u00edn, Colombia"}, {"name": "Carlos Andres Restrepo Garcia", "affiliation": "Deparment of Mechanical Engineering, Eafit University, Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u00a0"}], "tags": ["mechanical engineering", "correlation", "monitoring", "dynamics", "engineering profession", "education", "analysis of variance"]}, {"title": "Learning to think like a trainer: bringing Scratch for Educational Sciences professional\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formation", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658534", "abstract": "This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a study proposal with the intent of knowing Scratch potential in Educational Sciences students' training.

Much work has been done studying how EML affects learning, yet few studies look into the effect of the mindset on self-efficacy. Moreover, self-efficacy is known to differ depending on a person's race and ethnicity.

Teaching end-to-end anonymity algorithms, such as onion routing, has been a challenging task. This is primarily because of the inaccessibility of all the components that make up the end-to-end anonymity network. For example, an onion is the data structure formed by \u201dwrapping\u201d a message with successive layers of encryption to be decrypted by as many intermediary computers as there are layers before arriving at its destination. The intent of the onion routing algorithms is to protect the privacy of its users as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities from being monitored. In recent years, community research, specifically at the university level, into onion routing has ground to a halt and the limited resources for establishing private testing networks have fallen into a derelict state. The proposed solution is an elaborate walk-through, detailing the construction of an isolated onion routing network in which onion routing can be observed and verified in a controlled environment. Achieving this will require the configuration of several Directory Authorities, multiple nodes configured as Entry, Middle, and Exit relays, and the generation of a consensus. Once the consensus has been generated, the network will be able to build circuits across the nodes and fulfill the client's requests for information. When a packet capturing tool is applied to the various entities, the life of the packet as it traverses the network will be observed. The product of this endeavor was the creation of a complete virtual environment and detailed documentation of the steps necessary to construct a private onion routing network that can be readily utilized by educators and students to teach and learn the innerworkings of the OR algorithms. Constructing an isolated OR network, where all the network traffic is observable, is an essential first step in peeling back the next layer of onion routing.", "authors": [{"name": "Emil H Salib", "affiliation": "College of Integrated Science and Engineering, James Madison University\u00a0"}, {"name": "Grant Hobar", "affiliation": "College of Integrated Science and Engineering, James Madison University"}], "tags": ["routing", "routing protocols", "education", "encryption", "relays", "ip networks"]}, {"title": "What Software Engineering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Practices\u00e2\u20ac\u009d are we Teaching Students - a Systematic Literature Review", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658576", "abstract": "This research presents that teaching software engineering can be a demanding challenge for instructors, considering that the software industry grows rapidly and there are new development technologies being released constantly.

Context: Currently, the elderly population has increased in respect to the total population. According to Administration on Aging (AoA) for the year 2060, the elderly population will be double than presented in the results of the last census. Likewise, a reduced proportion of the population of elderly people is involved with technology or have a very close relation with it. However, the universal access to technology is important in the field of education and interactive systems due to the need of promoting the equality of opportunities for all. Moreover, it is considered that the effectiveness of e-Learning consists in knowing about the learning objectives of users and their needs. As a result of that, it is important to know the perceptions when users adopt any technology. The creation of a method for building massive open online courses (MOOCs) for elderly people named MOOCEP considers andragogical strategies to improve learning objects. This methodology has five tasks aligned to ADDIE method (i.e., Analysis, Design, Development, Deployment, and Evaluation). It presents a flexible and extensible solution, adaptable to any specific situation, to design and create effective MOOCs, which takes into consideration, that the e-learning process can vary considerably in complexity and size, depending on interest and needs of its target of people. Objective: In FIE 2017, it was presented the analysis task, which is related to the learning techniques and involves different considerations (i.e., andragogy, accessibility). For this year's FIE, in order to provide evidence on the use of MOOCs built by using MOOCEP, a group of 36 subjects aged from 65 to 85 years old had participated and provided their perceptions and suggestions by means of a questionnaire that allow us to understand the acceptance of the artifacts created by using this method. The user perceptions that have been measured are related to the ease of use, usefulness and the intention to use in the future. Method: In order to perform these tests, the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) has been employed. Results: The results have been favorable, and they provide insights that the method for building these artifacts allow the creation of easy to use and useful products, which can be considered as good technological elements to be employed for the education of elderly people.

To support teaching and learning of data analytics to industrial engineering students, this innovative practice full paper reports a pedagogical method that extrapolates product manufacturing processes to teaching and learning data analytics. We selected product manufacturing because it is a core course in the industrial engineering curriculum. The proposed pedagogical method is developed by first analyzing and comparing product manufacturing processes and data analytics techniques. Afterwards, we used the result of this analogy to develop a teaching and learning method for data analytics. For implementation and validation purposes, we adopt a project-based learning approach where students used our methodology to complete real-world data analytics projects.

Use of such pedagogies is increasingly common in engineering education, and evidence suggests that they are particularly effective at connecting engineering theory to practice, engaging engineering students motivated to \u201cmake an impact,\u201d and preparing engineering students for an increasingly globalized world. Community-engaged learning and similar pedagogies typically involve creating a partnership between campus partners (e.g. students, faculty, or staff) and community partners (e.g. community members or organizations) to address an engineering challenge that, if successful, will contribute to student learning and provide value to the community partners.

The partner relationship - the shared expectations, commitments, responsibilities, and trust (or lack thereof) between partners - appears to be vital. However, because it is not always the primary focus of those involved, and because partners' interests, incentives, epistemologies, and worldviews do not always align, partnerships frequently fail, leaving dissatisfaction and disillusionment among campus and community partners alike. This study employs a comparative case study approach using sets of interviews with students, instructors, and community partners involved in different sides of the same engineering projects. Some projects are retrospective while others are current, and some had positive outcomes (as defined by stakeholders) while others were less than positive. We present qualitative findings that suggest a set of considerations for mutually beneficial partnerships in community-engaged engineering courses and programs.

The audience will participate in puzzling out how to apply relevant concepts as we work through a scaffolded series of tricks centering on error detection and correction. The implementations also provide a useful model for incorporating greater interaction than is typically found in current innovative online interactive textbooks. In addition, they are samples for possible programming assignments that can motivate students using CS Unplugged activities to actively pursue deep programming experiences.", "authors": [{"name": "Dale F.

Three error message types were developed - Default, Link and Example, to better understand the effects of error messages. The Default type provides an assembler-centric single line error message, the Link type provides a program-centric detailed error description with a hyperlink for more information, and the Example type provides a program-centric detailed error description with a relevant example. A think aloud programming exercise was conducted to capture the student programmer's knowledge model. Different codes were developed to analyze the data collected as part of think aloud exercise. After transcribing, coding, and analyzing the data, it was found that the Link type of error message helped to fix the error in less time and with fewer steps.

In an effort to change that, a Concept Inventory test was applied to 195 students at Eafit University enrolled in Statics. All of the students took the test inside in the campus facilities and were monitored during the whole session to make sure they did not share information. The students took a Computer-Based Test of the Concept Inventory. Three new items were added to the original test of 27 questions, in order to improve the reliability of two specific groups of concepts. For the test was found a mean of 9.7 and a standard deviation of 5.28. For the overall test, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.81. The psychometric analyses show that all of the items in the test, except one, present an appropriate fit for discrimination and difficulty parameters of the test. Item 26 was deleted when performing the analysis of sub-scales reliability because presented abnormal value for difficulty. For the cluster of Equilibrium, it was seen that deleting this item resulted in an increase of the alpha from 0.2 to 0.36. For the sub-scale of Free-Body Diagram was seen a decrease in the reliability when two new items were added to it. All of the other sub-scales presented good reliability, most of them, above 0.5. The item-person map shows that the overall latent trait of students is lower than the overall test difficulty, meaning that most of the students found the test difficult. One of the conclusion to be drawn from the results is that the students subjected mainly to procedural approaches in teaching, do not perform well in conceptual tests.

Online discussion forums have become widely used in undergraduate classrooms. They extend the learning space beyond the classroom and provide asynchronous opportunities for peer-to-peer collaborations. Past studies have suggested that online posting behavior plays a role in students' learning outcomes; however, the study of the demographic characteristics of students who do or do not participate in online discussions is limited. We address this research question here. We chose our demographic variables based on prior studies of students' general online behaviors, and therefore we compare gender, race/ethnicity and international status, as well as declared majors, with engagement in the online forum. The discussion forum provided a platform for the students to ask or answer their peers' questions about the course material and homework assignments. The setting for this study was a sophomore-level dynamics and vibrations class that incorporated active, blended, and collaborative learning strategies. We tracked an individual's posting behavior throughout a semester. Study participants were grouped by whether they posted to the discussion forum at least once, and the Chi-squared test of independence was used to determine the statistical significance of demographic differences across the participation groups. The data show that female students were significantly more likely to be involved in online discussions than their male counterparts. Also, White and Asian American students were overrepresented, and international and Hispanic students were underrepresented in the engaged group. Interestingly, students who were required to take this specific course as a graduation requirement do not show more engagement than those who took this class for general engineering credits.

Additionally, few studies combine the research methods necessary to examine both student beliefs and classroom actions.

Our study uses ethnographic one-on-one interviews and video-recorded interactions to examine the collaboration and perspectives of two White male students in a 10-person laboratory section of an active learning introductory programming course for electrical engineers. Key findings include students' posturing about broad academic status and local assignment expertise that seemed to be triggered by prior experience and shared identities. In addition, views of peers as adversaries rather than partners in their work created a competitive interaction which was counterproductive to their learning and work.

Additionally, the study showed that the departure rates for underrepresented minorities (URM) (i.e., African-American, Native American, Pacific Islander American, and Hispanic American) are higher, as they complete their Ph.D. at lesser rates than their majority peers. Previous research has suggested that lack of motivation during the dissertation phase is one of the leading factors for students' decision to depart. This phase of the doctoral pursuit is often characterized as lonely and filled with uncertainty about the process towards degree completion.To address this problem, we have created the Dissertation Institute. This NSF-funded research project consists of a one-week workshop for underrepresented minorities in the final phases of their Ph.D. in engineering. The goal of the workshop is to offer a practical and timely experience for doctoral students to help them progress through degree completion. The design of this workshop is grounded in research to address issues typical of the final phases of the Ph.D., help shorten students' time-to-degree and increase doctoral completion rates for URM. While similar programs already exist, the Institute differs by simultaneously collecting research data that will further the understanding of the success and value beliefs of its participants and help develop future workshops.The purpose of this publication is to present a description of the Dissertation Institute as well as the evaluation results for its first implementation which took place in the summer of 2017. The evaluation plan consists of participant pre and post surveys, observations, and individual session assessments. Preliminary results show that the Dissertation Institute increased students' success beliefs and utility and cost-benefit value in academic writing. Results also showed that students appreciated having a safe space to communicate their academic concerns with session facilitators and fellow doctoral students. Students also expressed the individualized attention from the workshop facilitators aided in the transfer of the advice received throughout the multiple sessions to their specific pursuits. Findings from this evaluation will inform future development and implementations of the Institute and help inform the design of similar workshops.", "authors": [{"name": "Mayra S.

The process of change towards engineering being taught in K-12 classrooms involves the establishment of developmentally appropriate standards that inform curriculum. Established standards such as those of the NGSS and ITEEA STLs provide a nationally applicable framework for curricula throughout the United States. Nevertheless, it is important to critically consider what the foundations of such standards are in terms of empirical research. The development of rigorous standards for K-12 engineering education is a continuous process. Without a foundation of understanding for how children think about and learn engineering, standards will not optimally inform curricula how to teach engineering. So, do these foundations exist? The National Research Council (NRC) delivered a recommendation in 2010 to engage in the development of better understanding for how students learn engineering concepts in K-12. The intention of this recommendation was to facilitate effective and developmentally appropriate integration of engineering in K-12. The context of discussion in this recommendation was determining the viability and necessity of standards for engineering education in K-12. At the time, the committee determined fundamental questions were yet to be answered that would properly inform developmentally appropriate standards. This indicates that progress towards better understanding of student cognition had not occurred quickly. It is worth exploring to what extent observations such as these are currently accurate. Such shortcomings, if they exist, may critically inform initiatives within the educational research community. This systematic literature review will seek to uncover to what level fundamental research across several major publications in the past eight years focuses on critically describing the facets of child cognition and cognitive development in relation to the context of engineering in education.

We conducted a survey with Brazilian practitioners in order to collect data (N=90). For each testing topic, knowledge gaps were calculated as the difference between what respondents' learned/practiced in undergraduate courses and what they actually applied in industry after graduating. Results provide evidence on points that could be improved in software testing education. Firstly, for all testing topics there was a negative gap on practice activities. This means that students could benefit from more testing assignments throughout the curriculum. Regarding gaps in concepts, some testing topics presented negative gaps (such as test in web applications) and others positive (such as test in aspect oriented software and mutation analysis). Therefore, results suggest that it is possible to counterbalance them in order to reduce the existing gaps.

One such example would be International service learning projects (IESL) associated with the EPICS (Engineering Project in Community Services). There are also several other engineering organizations dedicated towards the needs in developed and developing countries such as Engineering without Borders, and Engineering for Sustainable World. These programs require engineering students, young professionals, and faculty members to get directly involved in international development initiatives and projects in the developing and underdeveloped countries. Traditionally, in the Service-learning literature, most of the studies have focused on the learning outcomes, perspectives, and experiences of the students in the domestic service learning programs. Although the research in domestic service learning program grounds in theory and the implications and results are valuable and useful, because of the complexities of cross-cultural differences associated with IESL programs, these findings may not be suitable and applicable for international service learning (IESL) programs. Through this paper, we report the lesson learned by the students and the faculty members engaged in an IESL program. Our initial findings suggest the intended as well as unintended lessons learned by the students and the faculty members engaged in the IESL program. We believe that the findings from this study will contribute to the growing literature of the engineering service learning research. The findings from this study can help the students and the faculty members engaged in IESL programs to set up a better understanding of the expectations from the IESL programs. The findings will also be useful for those service learning programs who engaged with International community partners.

The application design can help to solve this kind of problems. There is a need to understand such problems in the pedagogical level and then properly eliciting requirements that would address those problems.

The mixed methods study presented in this paper examines self-reported perceptions from students enrolled in a first year introduction to engineering computing course that utilized MATLAB as the programming language. Findings indicate that within this setting, students were generally confident in their ability to program in MATLAB and had a slight growth mindset towards programming.

Yet, there is a gap in knowledge on how learners' ability on various cognitive dimensions identified by Bloom's Taxonomy, is associated with their susceptibility to distinct persuasive strategies often used in PETs designs. To fill this gap, we conducted a large-scale study of 402 students to investigate how their cognitive ability scores relate to their susceptibility to persuasive strategies (Reward, Social Learning, and Trustworthiness) that are commonly used in PET design. We assessed the Cognitive ability scores using the test questions adapted from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) Kit.

The recent engineering education literature provides many conceptual frameworks for thinking about change in academic organizations, but comparatively few case studies of how departmental cultural change is operationalized both inside and beyond the classroom. Our approach to change was to organize \u201cgrassroots teams\u201d of students, faculty, and staff to tackle problems and challenges of recognized importance to the department. This paper details a number of key features of these grassroots teams, including: membership, training, leadership, problem scoping, facilitation, goal setting, formative and summative evaluations, and the outcomes of the teams work. The grassroots teams were organized according to several operating principles: (1) optimal team size is 6-8 people, and optimal project duration is around one semester; (2) to the extent possible, each team should have students, faculty, and staff representation; (3) teams generally follow our change model to complete their work; (4) all teams should strive for equity of voice, meaning that student and staff voices are equal to faculty voices; (5) the changes to be made did not require permission (i.e., approval from a curriculum committee or other formal entity; or the team members implicitly already had permission for change as a result of their job role); and (6) the teams should focus on student outcomes we care about. Our results refined our understanding of how change happens (or in some cases, does not happen) in our organization, with fascinating implications for ongoing and future efforts. The existence of these teams, and their mission around progressive change in the department, operated in tension with the prevailing attitudes about change in the department (\u201cwe tried that before, and it didn't work\u201d). Not every change effort was successful. The feedback from participants was nearly unanimous. They appreciated the structured and well-scoped nature of the projects. They especially welcomed the process we developed to facilitate change, which was very different from the usual committee structures in which they were used to working. And they felt excited to see that change was possible. Our specific grassroots team implementation will undoubtedly not work in all academic environments.

The Bug Hide-and-Seek educational game reinforces testing principles by requiring students to develop some correct solutions as well as some other solutions that intentionally contain bugs. While developing the correct and buggy solutions, students also write corresponding tests that should identify whether each solution contains bugs or exhibits acceptable behavior. Consequently, the first goal of the game is to hide a clever bug that will trick other students' tests into passing the implementation, despite the hidden bug. The second goal is to write thorough tests that can accurately differentiate correct from incorrect software behavior. We introduce the motivation, pedagogy, and preliminary analysis of two variations of the Bug Hide-and-Seek game, while comparing their tradeoffs. The between-subject variation considers each student's test suite in its entirety. The within-subject variation requires more sophisticated analysis, but considers each individual function along with its corresponding tests, which provides more granular insight and specific feedback to students. We conducted a pilot study of both variations over two semesters of students (n=87) playing the Bug Hide-and-Seek game.

Among various robotics kits, LEGO\u00ae Robotics has been shown one of the best results considering some evaluated criteria (modularity level, hardware, curriculum, price, etc.). Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO\u00ae Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO\u00ae Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out a systematic review of the literature. Our main findings are: a) the most widely used environment and programming language are LabVIEW along with the LEGO\u00ae's block-based programming language, b) we identified LEGO\u00ae Robotics is used for teaching programming, interdisciplinary contents, participation in tournaments, robotics, and computational thinking, c) LEGO\u00ae Robotics is used with success by students of different levels, such as K12, undergraduate, and graduated. Finally, we discuss some problems and limitations related to ER and point out that there is no standardization of teaching practices or methodologies for evaluating results, indicating that more research is needed to find the best scenario regarding technologies, methods, and target audience.", "authors": [{"name": "Livia M.

At many higher education institutions, including minority serving institutions, there is a need to address primary skill deficiencies in engineering students. These deficiencies in skills can be technical and non-technical (i.e., personal, soft). Most of the current efforts from faculty and existing educational programs, focus on developing technical skills, where the faculty makes an extraordinary effort to help students learn and understand the courses' contents. For this reason, the focus of this paper is on non-technical skills for student academic success. The objectives of this paper are (1) identify the potential skills necessary to thrive in an engineering program; this includes a literature review on skills, (2) define educational experiences as interventions to develop these skills in the students, and (3); explore the metrics associated with the selected skills; this is necessary to measure improvements. These skills will enable the self-transformation of students to be more effective and successful. It is expected that a critical mass of these students will promote and nourish communities of learners. These successful students will continue their transformation into professional innovators to tackle critical needs in their respective regions. Educational experiences on innovation will help in the development of specific skills to initiate a transformation in the student that can allow them to thrive in an engineering program. This transformation of self, community (as a student), and region (as a professional) can become a model that can be transferred to other institutions interested in preparing resilient learners.", "authors": [{"name": "Stephen Crown", "affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX, USA"}, {"name": "Noe Vargas Hernandez", "affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Arturo Fuentes", "affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["sociology", "mechanical engineering", "knowledge engineering", "technological innovation", "statistics", "education", "entrepreneurship"]}, {"title": "A case for the student researcher: Expanding the role of undergraduate research in the professional formation of engineers", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658757", "abstract": "This paper examines the role of social inquiry as a bridge between education and practice for undergraduate student researchers in engineering. Prior work has demonstrated the efficacy of undergraduate research (UR) as a tool to increase retention rates, particularly in STEM disciplines, and to encourage progression to graduate school. However, little work has been conducted on the role of UR in the development of professional skills for engineering students. Among such skills, the ability to work in complex socio-technical systems is a critical competency for professional engineers that is often under-addressed within a standard technical curriculum. In this paper, we used collaborative autoethnographic techniques to recall and reflect on three students' UR experiences working with a methodological approach, SenseMaker, which is designed to investigate emergent patterns and behaviors in complex, social systems, such as the systems involved in educating engineers, as well as those systems that engineers work with on a daily basis. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we found that using autoethnographic techniques to individually recall and collaboratively write and make sense of UR experiences facilitated the construction of novel insights of both personal and broader significance. Second, we found that providing undergraduate engineering students with the opportunity to systematically inquire into a social system served as an intellectual bridge between their highly structured and theoretical core engineering courses and the complexity of engineering in practice. Third, inquiry into the specific system of engineering education, in which the students themselves are important participants, provided students with an opportunity to experience, first hand, the value of meaningfully engaging all participants in a system, as they will be required to do as engineers working with non-engineers in their future professional roles. All three of these contributions point to a potentially much broader role of UR in engineering education as a way to further enhance the holistic professional formation of engineers. Collaborative systems inquiry within engineering education research can be a small-scale laboratory that allows students to develop problem solving skills within complex systems, while the empowerment of student researchers to study and improve their own education systems can simultaneously yield innovative perspectives in research.", "authors": [{"name": "Carol J.

Developing the skill to solve word problems is required to do well on exams, to complete the STEM degree, and to have a successful STEM career. There have been several efforts to develop tools that focus on predefined explanations of concepts or trying to determine the point of error in predefined problems. What is new and different about our tool called Pathway is its use of artificial intelligence (AI) to derive multiple solution paths to custom word problems that are created by the student. This paper presents a proof-of-concept of Pathway's ability to solve word problems; that is, it is the first word-problem solver. The first course we have chosen to apply Pathway to is Engineering Thermodynamics because it is a well-known weed out course, and mechanical engineering has a low 49% retention rate. Presently, Pathway shows students how to set up their word problems and assumptions and describes symbolic step-by-step solutions paths. Once the development of Pathway is complete and fully tested, we will investigate its effect on the exam scores of students. A study conducted with our prior e-learning tool resulted in an increase in exams scores of a letter grade and a half for Engineering Thermodynamics. However, since it used a limited set of predefined word-problems, the tool could not be used by other instructors who cover a different sequence of topics or used by students who want to explore what-if scenarios. Pathway is being developed to address those challenges.", "authors": [{"name": "Quintana M.

In-class lessons require no recruiting efforts to bring students to an outside computing program, and in most cases, no extra cost is incurred. However, the majority of K-12 teachers have no training in Computer Science and may lack confidence in presenting computing concepts to their students.

Our objective was to identify an approach to promote engineering policies using app development techniques for gamifying lab and classroom practices. This approach also promoted awareness among participants in order to ensure a safety culture designed for learning methods. The gamification techniques were deployed to support engineering courses based on tools involving instructional expectations, policies and procedures. The safety instructional policy was encouraged in student learning by implementing an interactive learning process that identifies specific instructional tools for classroom and lab assessment. This concept of gamification was introduced to engineering practices in order to integrate set policies and course procedures for interactive learning within approach for building a mindset in an educational environment. The gamification concept was used to promote a safety culture and has improved the quality of learning by engaging students in meaningful practices. The concept has also reinforced safety standards for undergraduate engineering students in course and lab instructions. The course and lab instructions were implemented for the purpose of managing and promoting awareness among participants as a systematic approach to foster safe practices in engineering education. Overall, gamification has engaged undergraduate engineering students both inside and outside the educational environment. The undergraduate engineering students would often overlook, ignore or misinterpret the safety practices due to the lack of awareness and safety importance. The gamified approach has identified common malpractices concerning safety instructional policy and guidelines for classroom and lab operation. Gamification of safety instructional policy has created self-awareness to undergraduate engineering students and the influence of safety training procedures was mapped to student-learning outcomes.

The emergence of a gender balance target and government imperatives for Scottish university courses has challenged computer science as a discipline across the 14 universities in which computing is currently taught. The funding body target is that there should be a more equal gender balance, with no course having fewer than 25% of one gender, leading to a proliferation of gender action plans across the university sector. Of course the phenomenon of under-representation extends across developed countries in the west, albeit with a small number of high profile resource-intensive interventions making headway. At present the percentage of women studying computing in the UK is 17%. The lack of female applicants to courses suggests that subject decisions have been made through previous experiences prior to selecting a course and university. Surveying current computer science students (n=185) we explored women's and men's reasons for studying computer science, their influencers and their early experiences of computing. The aim of the study was to examine the motivations and influences that led them to a positive choice of computer science in order to find evidence on which to build a gender action plan. We found that women were introduced to computing at different stages (including home, early schooling and secondary schooling), whereas men were more likely to have been introduced to computers at home. Women also cited slightly more varying reasons for selecting CS, while men were more likely to select it based on personal interest. Both men and women were influenced by friends and family. However, men were slightly more likely than women to make the decision to study computing by themselves, not citing any other influence.

Traditionally, students learn about the engineering design process through design-only projects such as redesigning an electric toothbrush or selecting components for a renewable-energy powered water well. Although these projects were hands-on, they did not include students converting the design concept to a tangible product. In fall 2017, a new project using Arduino kits was introduced to the course. Students were asked to build a line-following robot car with a chassis of their own design as long as it kept the wires and circuit board inside. In designing the robot car, students sketched design concepts, selected the best one, and used low-fidelity materials to create beta prototypes. Once they had a working chassis, students created it in Autodesk Inventor and realized the final design of the chassis through 3D printing and laser cutting.To measure if the new hands-on project has an impact on student learning, students were asked to report which instructional activity they learn best from and how they relate engineering design to real life before and after the project. We found that at the completion of the robot car project, students became less in favor of lecture-based instructions. Rather, they have developed a preference in figuring out the solutions on their own. Students highly appreciated the open-ended design project and the hands-on experience of building a prototype.As with any project carried out for the first time, the robot car design project ran into some technical difficulties.

The results obtained from a multi-complex environment have aided students and improved their decision approach to quantify data accuracy and project requirements in education practices for predictive learning. In using the data sets developed from Watson Analytics, this assembly of display in multi-complex environments provided students with the ability to assess and understand the visual presentation to determine predictive models in data exploration. Data exploration was used to identify a research approach in the education assessment of the multi-complex environments of engineering students' projects. The multi-complex environments and the variables assessment also provided insight with an understanding of project requirements and objectives using data visualization techniques and decision relationships gained from data exploration. This approach investigated the learning methods and decision practices through pattern recognition, educational objectives and course outcomes in specific multi-complex environments with efforts supporting research to practices. The integration of analytics tools with regard to decision-based learning allowed the engineering students the ability to forecast requirements and create new methods critical to their engineering design. This was significant due to the students' ability to model decisions in a manner that experts had challenged engineering education using research to practices to address aspects of the multi-complex environments based on industry standards.

The difficulty of understanding abstraction presented by engineering students in computational problems solving is one of the main reasons for numerous pitfalls in the early college semesters. When teaching abstract contents, such as computer programming, it is relevant to include as many practical exercises and laboratories experiments as possible, to facilitate a better understanding. These practical approaches allow the students to achieve, by simulations or by real experiences, good notions of the basic concepts of the subject being studied. To motivate engineering students to be acquainted with formal definitions and high-level abstractions, a Didactic Framework focused on the teaching of the C programming language for embedded systems was developed and tested. Moreover, the students were supposed to develop a software project in teams that work together to solve basic tasks, and that compete at the end of the semester by solving a common programming challenge. This work is divided into two main parts: one focusing on the creation of practical strategies that make easier understanding complex definitions; and another concerning to the motivational strategies through cooperation and competition.

The goal of this survey is to characterize student profiles in order to develop and examine particular interventions to guide students toward success in engineering and computing majors. This survey measures non-cognitive attributes including personality, sense of belonging, engineering or computing identity, study skills, well-being, and a variety of other constructs that are not routinely measured in engineering populations nor integrated into admission decisions, advising processes, or academic curricula. Prior research indicates that these non-cognitive attributes are important for students' academic success and retention. However, no studies have examined a comprehensive set of non-cognitive traits holistically to understand how they influence student success. This collaborative project, funded by three linked NSF grants, merges the interests of researchers at three campuses in understanding and supporting students with varied non-cognitive profiles. As part of this research, we negotiated the content of a national survey, suitable for use on our own campuses as well as with other national partners, to probe more than a dozen constructs collectively describing student non-cognitive attributes. The construction of the survey itself was non-trivial, and involved significant negotiations among the researchers including initial collection of instruments with validity evidence to serve as a basis for discussion; an in-person kick-off meeting; multiple follow-up teleconferences; multiple rounds of inclusion/exclusion decisions based upon mutually-agreed upon guiding principles; pilot survey testing; pilot data evaluations such as exploratory factor analysis; and final decisions about instruments/items to include in the final version, all while considering survey length, distribution channels, and key IRB concerns. This paper details the 10-month effort to construct a survey that meets the research needs and intellectual curiosity of partners at three diverse campuses. In this process, we had to balance the different institutional contexts of the funded partner sites while also maintaining flexibility for national distribution. The deliberate processes we used may serve as a template for future survey creation, starting from constructs of interest, to selection of specific instruments (or sub-scales thereof), and factor analysis to consider further down-selection of individual items to include in the final survey. The outcomes of this paper may serve the engineering education community by highlighting previously undocumented processes in collaborative survey construction that introduce intellectual complexity or time delays into the development timeline.", "authors": [{"name": "Allison Godwin", "affiliation": "School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907\u00a0"}, {"name": "John Chen", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93407\u00a0"}, {"name": "Edward Berger", "affiliation": "School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ryan Senkpeil", "affiliation": "School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jim Widmann", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93407\u00a0"}, {"name": "Julianna Ge", "affiliation": "School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907\u00a0"}, {"name": "Brian Self", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93407\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ann Gates", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, TX, 79902"}, {"name": "Matthew Scheidt", "affiliation": "School of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907\u00a0"}], "tags": ["sociology", "mechanical engineering", "collaboration", "delay effects", "instruments", "testing", "statistics"]}, {"title": "Evaluating the Influence of PBL on the Development of Soft Skills in a Computer Engineering Undergraduate Program", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658832", "abstract": "This research full paper investigates the development of soft skills of undergraduate students in a Computer Engineering program that uses problem-based learning (PBL) as its main learning approach.

For that reason, undergraduate programs have been pushing to add the development of soft skills in their curriculum. One way to accomplish that change is using active learning approaches. Such approaches usually lead to more student participation in the learning process and, consequently, the development of particular soft skills. This research investigates the use of the active learning approach of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to enable the development of soft skills of Computer Engineering undergraduate students. Students' skills were assessed through a Likert Scale questionnaire, investigating eight skill categories: Self-Management, Management, Interpersonal skills, Communication, Leadership, Decision Making and Problem Solving, Organization, and Analysis and Creativity.

Although benefits of such technology-enhanced labs are well-known, the best approach to integrate these labs to achieve best outcomes for learning is still an exploratory area of research. In this paper, existing literature on virtual labs implementation for systems-level courses in computing is analyzed and classified into two stages of evolution. In the first stage, technical design & evaluation is the focus while in the second stage, pedagogy and learning theories and principles are used as the basis in designing technology innovations as well as teaching & learning activities. The second stage has the advantage of theoretical principles guiding the design of teaching and learning activities and technology artifacts with a focus to achieve learning outcomes and thus a higher potential to achieve learning goals. However, we observe only a few studies taking this approach. This paper presents the design of a holistic technology-enhanced pedagogical framework incorporating a virtual laboratory for a systems and network administration course. The framework applies theories such as Constructive Alignment for curriculum design and Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle, Bloom's Taxonomy and Collaborative Learning to design teaching & learning activities and assessments.

Recent national calls to reform undergraduate engineering education has led to extensive research in the identification and development of effective instructional strategies. Project-based learning (PBL) is one instructional strategy that has received empirical and anecdotal support for its ability to instill professional skills in addition to technical content knowledge in engineering graduates. Engineering programs have increasingly adopted PBL in the form of capstone engineering design courses, entrepreneurship courses, and co-curricular experiences. However, PBL is broadly defined in the literature, and as such, these adaptations are often nuanced in their design, structure, and pedagogical approaches; and consequently, may have differing impact on student learning outcomes. Engineering design and entrepreneurship courses are two commonly used avenues in which engineering students are exposed to PBL. In design courses, students often work in teams to complete tasks that lead to devising an engineering solution to a given `real-world' problem. Most, if not all, engineering students gain exposure to PBL via capstone design courses that are often required in the engineering curriculum. In addition to design courses, entrepreneurship courses also expose engineering students to PBL by engaging them in entrepreneurial projects in which students work in teams, often conceptualizing and designing products. While the engineering design process is more focused on the outcome solution to the problem, entrepreneurship design processes tend to emphasize the front end of the design process, specifically opportunity identification and validation. Students engage in customer discovery and develop prototype solutions. Although nuanced, we hypothesize that due to these different approaches, engineering design and entrepreneurship will have varied impact on student learning outcomes. In our presented work, we investigate these differences by examining changes in students' perceived risk-taking abilities, creative self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy in engineering design and entrepreneurship practicum courses. Preliminary results show that entrepreneurial self-efficacy increases in both design and entrepreneurship courses. However, differences in the magnitude of change for its subconstructs are noted between the two courses. In contrast, increase in risk-taking and creative self-efficacy is only found in the entrepreneurship course and not in the engineering design course.

Nowadays, 70% of the top companies have robust digital transformation (DT) teams, and 40% of them are being driven by high ICT and Artificial and Computational Intelligence. In other hand, very few Colombian universities have tackled the problem of competitiveness in higher education (HE), much less they have made the transition to the IV Industrial Revolution by taking the leap, thus receiving a tremendous blow due to academic obsolescence. In the recent ANDICOM (ICT International Congress, numerous national cases of domestic DT were presented from companies, but, unfortunately, not a single case of HE. Will the case of computerization in Colombia, be replicated, which was left to the discretion of transnational computer elites? The University DT implies necessarily the cognimatics (the informatics for the Knowledge Society) of all the companies, and their social insertion in this country. Why University Architecture: Enterprise Architecture (EA): Architecting implies the organization of subsystems or components to obtain better and/or new functionalities. If any component is knowledge-based, an intelligent behavior is obtained. The architecture-multilayer approach is a system of systems (SoS) one, that ensures compliance with government policies, rules and standards, in a highly complex social institution with intellectual assets and knowledge processes, which is a usual situation in a university institution; this approach describes the subsystems at a higher level, where a system is made-up, and with the protocols by which they communicate. EA and Business Architecture constitute a conceptual tool that helps the organizations to understand their own structure and the approach by which they work. It provides a business 360\u00b0 vision map, and planning frame for business and technological changes. EA is presented like a system overall configuration of subsystems or components organized in layers, where each one describes an ordered congregation of structures and common functionalities grouped by a purposeful criterion inside the business. Our Proposal: We present a succinct outline of our architectural dual model (data-knowledge), of the digital university transformation. It is a dual DT model: curricular digitalization and institutional digitalization, i.e. knowledge and data. The pillars of the architecture are Funding, Research, Entrepreneurship and Social Projection, recognizing from the start, that Knowledge has its ethos in the University; they correspond to: 1-Productive Ecosystem of the transformation. 2-DT that enhance the knowledge and innovation in the universities for the habilitation of the digital capacities. 3-A new economy that requires transformation, also supported on entrepreneurship. 4-New DT human talent required by the new industry of knowledge and intelligence. The student hyper-personalization by competences and skills is required. We discuss the basic, conceptual aspects, and methodology for the DT, applying some intelligent constructs that we have developed and documented in the last 10 years leading the DT in Postsecondary Education (PSEd).", "authors": [{"name": "Jesus Alfonso Perez Gama", "affiliation": "Fundaci\u00f3n de Educaci\u00f3n Superior San Jos\u00e9, Research and Innovation International Group U San Jose EIDOS, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia"}], "tags": ["computer architecture", "organizations", "technological innovation", "productivity", "ecosystems", "education"]}, {"title": "Effects of immediate feedback using ICT in a CS1 course that implements Mastery Learning", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658845", "abstract": "This work in progress paper presents an innovative practice integrating concepts of Mastery Learning in a Computer Science 1 (CS1) course.

To model such tasks, we have adapted the ELO technique to apply a matchmaking process similar to that used in choosing opponents in chess tournaments or online matches. We used as a case study a virtual learning environment which has a repository with programming problems and the users interaction log. In this work we propose an extension to the traditional ELO model. In the classical model, ELO is a scalar value for each student and for each learning object.

Rather than rely on High School grades as a predictor of eventual success in tertiary (ICT-related) engineering, we have adopted a more open-entry model, but require a high performance from the students over their compulsory first year courses in order to progress in engineering study. In this paper we examine whether this is a satisfactory predictor of eventual student success (based on grade performance), or is it that issues such as High-School to University transition unduly negatively influence these grades and lead to a decision not to allow an otherwise capable student to progress. To examine this, we compare student GPAs and graduation rates between a four year Bachelor of Engineering and a three year Bachelor of Science degree which share similar courses.

Vector group of the three-phase transformer is an essential topic in electrical engineering curricula at universities. Typically, vector group of the three-phase transformer is taught in the classroom using pure theorem. In this paper, the advantages of hardware and software tools are used to reinforce the teaching of vector group of a three-phase transformer. Firstly, an object-oriented vector group of three-phase transformer simulation environment is constructed using Simulink. Secondly, to verify the validity of the simulation results, portable hardware tools of vector group of a three-phase transformer are integrated into the classroom. The main components consist of three single-phase transformers, a smart oscilloscope, and a mini inverter. Because of the components' compact size, low weight, low voltage, low current, and reasonable cost, they are very suitable for a lecturer to integrate them into the electric machinery course. The effect of some forms of vector groups on the reduction of harmonics is also presented. The proposed methods have been successfully used at Kasetsart University Sriracha Campus, Thailand. They can help students to understand vector group of a three-phase transformer and assists lecturers to enhance the effectiveness of the teaching.

As the demand for cybersecurity-trained professionals rapidly increasing, virtual hands-on lab systems have been introduced into cybersecurity education as a tool to enhance students' learning. To improve learning in a virtual hands-on lab system, instructors need to understand: what learning activities are associated with students' learning performance in this system? What relationship exists between different learning activities? What instructors can do to improve learning outcomes in this system? However, few of these questions has been studied for using virtual hands-on lab in cybersecurity education. In this research, we present our recent findings by identifying that two learning activities are positively associated with students' learning performance. Notably, the learning activity of reading lab materials (p <; 0:01) plays a more significant role in hands-on learning than the learning activity of working on lab tasks (p <; 0:05) in cybersecurity education.In addition, a student, who spends longer time on reading lab materials, may work longer time on lab tasks (p <; 0:01).", "authors": [{"name": "Zhen Zeng", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Yuli Deng", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "IHan Hsiao", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Chun-Jen Chung", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA"}, {"name": "Dijiang Huang", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["education", "servers", "informatics", "logic gates", "task analysis", "computer security"]}, {"title": "Faculty Apprentice as a Mentorship Model for Engineering Graduate Students interested in Teaching", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658858", "abstract": "This paper presents a new model of mentoring engineering graduate students called faculty apprenticeship, which is aimed at helping prepare graduate students to become effective teachers. Engineering education scholars have pointed out that graduate school usually falls short in preparing engineering graduate students for a career as faculty. Moreover, graduate students lack deliberate opportunities to practice and gain genuine teaching experience. Students who are appointed as teaching assistants (TAs) do not always get opportunities to teach and are mostly restricted to supporting the instructor as necessary. With an increasing focus on developing strategies to better prepare graduate students for their teaching role in academia, we address this challenge through the model of faculty apprenticeship. The faculty apprentice approach was implemented in the school of engineering education at a large Midwestern university. In this paper, we present the rationale of the faculty apprentice approach, which is located within the conceptual frameworks of the mentoring and apprenticeship models. We look at the experiences of two professors and two graduate students who served as instructors and faculty apprentices respectively throughout several semesters. The data is collected in the form of reflections and is examined through a qualitative constructivist lens to inform engineering educators on the mutual benefits of this approach. The results that emerged from the combined experiences of faculty and students provide a reasonable argument on how the faculty apprentice approach benefits both faculty and students. The results also present the process involved in successfully running the model. We believe the faculty apprentice approach is compatible and complementary with current efforts being taken by engineering colleges towards professional development of graduate students. The intention of this paper is to spark interest among instructors and provide information to transfer this approach from engineering education to other engineering disciplines.", "authors": [{"name": "Rohit Kandakatla", "affiliation": "School of Engineering Education Purdue University West Lafeyette, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Juan D.

By measuring cohorts of students at different stages in the mechanical engineering curriculum, correlations are made between the level of involvement in makerspaces and GPA. The results indicate that students who use the space to build and create, either by choice or for a course requirement, have been shown to have a higher average in-major GPA than students who do not use the space.

We used structural equation modeling to examine a set of hypotheses: 1) out-of-school experiences would be mediated by interest and recognition in physics and STEM and no direct effect will be found for out-of-school experiences on physics and STEM identities, 2) these identities subsequently predict engineering possible selves, and 3) engineering possible selves will predict certainty of career path. The results of our structural equation modeling analysis supported our hypotheses, out-of-school experiences alone are not enough to develop an identity as a physics person or STEM person, rather they need to be mediated through recognition by others and an underlying interest. A physics identity and a broad STEM identity were found to significantly predict students engineering possible selves.

According to self-determination theory (SDT), positive forms of motivation arise when people experience a sense of competence, relatedness, and autonomy. In learning settings, these three basic psychological needs are satisfied when students feel a sense of efficacy and mastery; a supportive connection to others; and choice and control. Research illustrates that instructors play an important role in creating environments that support these three needs through their pedagogical choices, interactive style, and classroom culture and climate setting. In this study, we explore relationships among students' needs satisfaction, perceptions of the learning climate, and situational motivations. Participants in the study are first-year undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a technical course that uses non-traditional pedagogies to integrate math, science, and engineering. Student responses to the Situational Motivation Scale, Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction scale, and Learning Climate Questionnaire are analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, and bivariate correlations. Consistent with SDT predictions, our findings show that students' needs satisfaction and positive evaluations of the learning climate correlate positively to autonomous motivations. We also observe that students' positive motivations are not entirely temporally stable. Over a one-week period in a course project, students report a significant drop in positive motivations followed by a quick recovery.

In developing the leadership component of the degree, the faculty understood that one of the most effective methods by which people learn to develop as leaders is through practice. Therefore, rather than place all leadership development in a single course in the Engineering Leadership Program (E-Lead), the degree was designed to have a coordinated thread of leadership development throughout the degree plan, encompassing both curricular and extracurricular opportunities. Focused heavily on practice and application, a framework for leadership development was designed to take a tiered approach. For all students, in-class activities introduce fundamental concepts of engineering leadership in the context of teamwork and engineering project management in the E-Lead courses. For those students interested in more in-depth experience and training, additional extracurricular leadership development opportunities were made available in the form of coaching or attending leadership conferences and workshops. In all of these activities, the focus is on helping students to develop their character, capacity, and competence.

To address this gap, the present study seeks to compare live, late, and archive learners' intentions, interests, and behaviors in accessing the course materials in a highly technical engineering MOOC. Utilizing the Kruskal-Wallis test, we find that live learners desire to achieve a passing grade at the onset of the course, while archive learners are less concerned about grades. Also, learners who work full-time tend to enroll late, while full-time students tend to enroll as live or archive learners. Most importantly, while similar classes of behaviors are found in all groups, a significantly greater proportion of archive-mode learners complete the course than live or especially late-enrolling learners.

The most common ESI topics taught to EE students were: professional practice issues, safety, and the societal impacts of technology. Fewer EE faculty taught sustainability and environmental protection issues compared to other disciplines. Within EE courses where faculty integrated ESI, the most common ESI teaching methods were engineering design, case studies, and examples of professional scenarios.

In this paper, we analyze course scores, quiz results and self-stated skill levels of our participants. The aim of our analysis is to uncover factors influencing the retention of acquired knowledge, such as time passed or knowledge application, in order to improve long-term success. While we know that some participants learned the programming basics within our course, we lack information on whether this knowledge was applied and fortified after the course's end. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a survey in 2018 among all participants of our 2015 and 2017 programming MOOCs. The first part of the survey elicits responses on whether and how MOOC knowledge was applied and gives participants opportunity to voice individual feedback. The second part of the survey contains several questions of increasing difficulty and complexity regarding course content in order to learn about the consolidation of the acquired knowledge. We distinguish three programming knowledge areas in the survey: First, understanding of concepts, such as loops and boolean algebra. Second, syntax knowledge, such as specific keywords. Third, practical skills including debugging and coding. We further analyzed the long-term effects separately per participant skill group.

A majority of students found flowcharting easier than Python (63%), and reported that flowcharting helped them understand how to write programs in Python (73%). However, flowcharting is not a magic bullet for learning programming because about 31% of students have difficulty solving problems with a flowcharting tool (and Python). We also found that the ability of students to read code is not highly correlated with their ability to write code in Python.

Actually, issues related to teaching and learning have been increasingly discussed and studied lately, particularly regarding the development and delivery of computational learning applications. In this scenario, the existing learning applications, despite having several benefits and facilities, present problems and challenges that still need to be better investigated.

The goal of this work was to identify students' perceptions of their interaction with an open source project as a real world experience. To do so, we performed three mixed-methods case studies with three different undergraduate classes. Each class had a different focus: i) software maintenance and evolution, ii) software testing, and iii) reverse engineering of software requirements. Results show that students perceived features that make OSPs close to industrial projects, realized that their OSP tasks are close to the ones in industrial projects, and also faced difficulties typical of working with real world software.

Close monitoring by teachers has been identified as a critical factor for student's success. However, it may be difficult for teachers to stay up-to-date at any moment about each of their students' overall progress and capabilities. For this purpose, we have developed a tool that collects snapshots of the students' source code whenever they compile it. The snapshots are processed, and a series of visualizations and aggregated data is made immediately available for teachers. Since teachers can't be permanently looking at the system, we have also developed an automatic notification system, based on cognitive theories of selective attention, which will notify teachers about numerous relevant aspects concerning their students' performance. We present the results of a field experiment, which confirms that the tool indeed allows teachers to have a deeper insight into their students' performance and progress, enabling them to make more grounded interventions.", "authors": [{"name": "Nuno Gil Fonseca", "affiliation": "College of Technology and Management of Oliveira do Hospital, Polytechnic Institute of Coimbra, Oliveira do Hospital, Portugal\u00a0"}, {"name": "Maria Jose Marcelino", "affiliation": "Dep.

Research has shown that novice programmers struggle with learning introductory concepts and find it difficult to monitor their own progress. Teachers often have hundreds of students and multiple sections of programming courses to teach, making it infeasible to provide the amount of independent feedback each student may need to flourish. With limited instructor feedback, students who can self-monitor and self-assess their programming metacognition have a higher chance of developing a process for solving programming challenges. In this paper, we expand on the literate programming paradigm by using natural language processing and machine learning methods to automatically analyze and classify student programming metacognition levels through their source code comments. Our intent is to ultimately integrate our classification models into an interactive developer environment to provide real-time feedback to students about their metacognition while learning to program.", "authors": [{"name": "Amy Barton", "affiliation": "Technical Communication Program, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, MS, USA"}, {"name": "M.

Tutorials are accompanied by practical demonstrations, and collaborative, guided discussions. The inclusion of these tutorials, along with other minor changes to the course content, has shown marked improvements in students' grades, retention, student evaluations and, most importantly, a change in many students' perception of the value of a coherent body of knowledge separate to that necessary to perform well in assessments.

In this work, we explore how students' cognitive (e.g., study skills, test performance, regulatory behaviors, etc.) and non-cognitive factors (e.g., identity, motivation, personality, etc.) predict student success in their engineering pathways. The data for this initial study comes from a pilot survey, deployed in the summer of 2017, of 490 engineering and computing students from two large, public institutions, one on the West Coast, the other in the Midwest. We used multiple linear regression to control for demographic variables while examining the predictive value of particular cognitive and non-cognitive factors for student academic achievement (i.e., GPA) in university. Our analysis shows, not surprisingly, that standardized test scores only explain a small portion of the variance of undergraduate GPA. Including non-cognitive and affective factors into a regression model produced a marked increase in the explained variance. Our work is novel in examining a constellation of possible factors that predict undergraduate student GPA, by combining both cognitive and non-cognitive factors as predictors.

The construction industry is facing a severe shortage of skilled workforce. As the baby boomers are retiring, the younger generation, especially college students, are often criticized for their lack of professional experience and career-specific competency. To close the skills gap and accelerate the transition of college students to competent workforce, this paper proposed a new genre of learning and professional training using MR. The main promise of the MR technology resides in its ability to augment virtual contents on top of the physical reality to facilitate tacit knowledge learning, and simulate learning activities that traditionally can only be obtained from actual professional experience. An undergraduate wood framing lab was designed as a case study to explore how students might perform in this new learning and training environment. Specifically, the case study investigated if MR would facilitate student design comprehension and transfer such understanding into the knowledge and skills needed to build the wood structure. A randomly selected student control group was given traditional paper-based construction drawings to perform the same tasks with other student groups with various visualization technology assistance. Project performance and behavior of student groups were compared to determine if there was a significant difference between the control group and the experiment groups. A pair of pre- and post-survey on MR-intervened learning experience was also conducted to explore student perceptions towards this new genre of learning and training.

Virtual computer labs bring advantages, such as anywhere, anytime, on-demand access of specialized software and hardware.

This work is grounded in self-determination theory, which suggests that motivation exists not just in the binary (motivated or not), but rather in a continuum from extrinsic to intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation, the type most associated with positive learning outcomes, is supported for an individual when their particular environment meets their basic psychological needs. Basic psychological need fulfillment is the extent to which an individual experiences autonomy, competence, and relatedness to others in a particular context.

There were two mathematics tasks (one active and one passive) and two Python programming tasks (one active, one passive). Subjects were fitted with wearable brainwave sensors that captured cortical oscillations from four scalp electrodes, and transformed the signals from each electrode into five distinct frequency bands. This yielded 10 samples per second within each frequency band and from each electrode. We then trained ensemble-based machine learning algorithms (boosting and bagging of decision tree learners) to classify various features of tasks and subjects from a single sample of brainwave activity. We explored several different types of training/testing regimes, and our results suggest that within a single session, brain activity patterns for each of these four types of learning are substantially different, but that the patterns do not generalize well between sessions.

With tools such as laser-cutters and 3-D printers readily available to students, faculty need no longer wait for senior design to ask students to physically realize a design that's relevant to a class topic. Our hypothesis was that the primary barrier preventing faculty from assigning in-depth prototype-based class projects was their own unfamiliarity with the tools the students would need to use to create those prototypes. We created a summer workshop on the fabrication capabilities of our maker-spaces and entrepreneurially-minded learning (EML) and delivered it to over 30 faculty and staff in the summer of 2017. Our workshop aimed to increase faculty familiarity with these tools and with the pedagogical approaches that leverage them and thereby empower faculty to assign open-ended, prototype-based experiences that center value-creation. Faculty were further coached on inductive pedagogical approaches such as problem-based learning. The subset of faculty that attended at least three different topical workshops and the pedagogy workshop went on to develop and share new assignments for their courses.

Cyber security is so important that it can no longer be just a topic or a track - it is the way in which ALL software should be written. It should be taught in almost every course in a computer science curriculum because cyber security affects every major software component in any computing system. The modules are designed to be independent and loosely coupled, which enables them to be integrated into courses offering similar course content within the program, other computing related programs, or courses offered by other colleges and universities. The modules introduce students to the various concepts of cyber security from the freshman year, to ensure that fundamental programming concepts are taught from a security perspective - building a strong cyber security foundation for future courses. This innovative approach of teaching cyber security across various computing curricula will widen the pipeline to meet the demand of the nation for cyber security educated professionals.", "authors": [{"name": "Jeong Yang", "affiliation": "Department of Computing and Cyber Security, Texas A&M University \u2013 San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ummugul Bulut", "affiliation": "Department of Computing and Cyber Security, Texas A&M University \u2013 San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA"}, {"name": "Akhtar Lodgher", "affiliation": "Department of Computing and Cyber Security, Texas A&M University \u2013 San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["wheels", "ciphers", "servers", "encryption", "computer science", "computer security", "education"]}, {"title": "Effects of Professional Development on Programming Knowledge and Self-Efficacy", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659041", "abstract": "This Research Full Paper presents the effects of our weeklong Professional Development class on the programming skills of nineteen high school teachers, their confidence in programming, and their confidence for teaching programming.

Previous research has shown that students' pre-college characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic indicators, race/ethnicity, gender) inform their experiences in college, as well as their academic and social outcomes. For example, research suggests that students from low-socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds participate in co-curricular activities at lower rates than their high-SES counterparts. In this study, we hypothesize that precollege characteristics (e.g., race, gender, legacy status), resources (e.g., access to college counselors or private tutors), and experiences (e.g., participation in pre-college engineering programs) combine to inform how students are socialized into college broadly, and into engineering specifically. Using survey data collected from 998 undergraduate engineering students, we conducted a set of nested multiple regression models to investigate the relationships between students' pre-college characteristics and both their college experiences and outcomes. Results offer some support for our hypotheses that some precollege characteristics, resources, and experiences, such as gender and college course taking in high school, are significant predictors of undergraduate engineering students' college experiences, such as students' general socializing experiences and feedback seeking behaviors.

Engineering faculty, however, often view writing in ways at odds with both of these developments: treating writing as something to be taught elsewhere or integrating writing into engineering courses without incorporating feedback or revision. This mismatch is problematic, because improving engineering students' writing is a critical problem for engineering education. Additionally, feedback is often unfeasible within the constraints of many engineering courses-instructor time and large student-faculty ratios. One potential way to address these concerns is to use peer feedback. An open question, however, is how instructor and peer feedback practices differ and how that difference impacts students' revising process. We present results of an empirical analysis of peer vs. instructor feedback on a writing assignment in a large first-year engineering course.

We argue that this goal is typically not even closely reached and provide an analysis indicating factors explaining this situation. The analysis is based on the concept of professional identity.In earlier work [1] a framework with which to reason about student interactions with the regulatory structure of higher education and teachers was developed. In that paper we developed a compound model which not only relates these players to one another, but also provides approaches to reasoning about misalignments which arise when students and teachers approach their shared learning context from different perspectives. This framework is in this paper applied to address different aspects of professional identity with the intent of bringing forth deeper insights into challenges with educating towards professions.

Collaborative development approaches bring also the potential benefit to contribute to learning activities. For instance, novices might participate on collaborative development sessions in order to learn new development practices, tools, and techniques used in a software development project. Besides these potential benefits, little is known about the perception of students engaged in collaborative development efforts. Therefore, in this paper we investigate whether or not the engagement of students in collaborative development efforts contributes to the learning process of software development practices and techniques, as well as the perceived benefits and challenges related to collaborative software development activities. To this end, we first performed several of coding dojo sessions during a period of 18 months. These development sessions have been conducted within the context of a real software modernization effort, which aims to modernize two enterprise systems of the Brazilian Army. After that, we carried out a qualitative study where the participants (students, software developers, and software architects) answered a survey, in order to understand the learning benefits of using coding dojo in software development activities. The results so far are encouraging. Coding Dojos allowed professors and software architects to seamless share their experience in software development with the students. According to the answers, the methodology created a better environment for the team, allowing better discussions and ideas to be shared and implemented. This has helped the team members to solve problems easier than by themselves, bringing additional benefits, such as steep the learning curve in programming languages, usage of development tools, understanding the requirements, and code refactoring.", "authors": [{"name": "Henrique Faria", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, University of Bras\u00edlia - (UnB), P.O.

The scenarios that are glimpsed, require the engineer to have specific competences that must be developed in their training process.Proposals such as the 2020 engineer suggest, among other things, that engineering education must be transformed to help achieve the vision and to develop innovations in, hitherto, unknown fields for engineers. Higher education challenge in engineering is to train students to become modern and effective engineers capable of participating and leading conception, design, implementation and operation of systems, products and projects. For this, the students must not only be prepared technically, but also be socially responsible and have the capacity to be innovating permanently. Modern engineering projects require a combination of several disciplines, so engineering schools must incorporate them into existing programs and through activities outside the classroom.Additionally, research as the basis of teaching and training allows the teacher to leave aside the role of passive mediator between theory and practice. One of the methodologies for carrying this out is the classroom research project with students. This didactic strategy aims at producing changes in the professor's paradigms, passing from passive methodologies to active and constructivist pedagogical practices in the classroom.This paper presents the experiences of the professors of the College of Engineering and Basic Sciences of Polite\u0301cnico Grancolombiano using research projects in the classroom. They show that altering classroom situations encourage meaningful learning for students, supports quality education and foster on the professors the development of, among others, pedagogical, technological and communicative, competences.Some research projects done by students in their in the classroom are: Crutches designed with a weight dampening system in the technical design area; Technical requirements for the design of a food packaging in the industrial engineering program; Electronic Menu (Each table has a tablet that shows the different liquors offered, the customer has the possibility to select the desired one, as well as to make mixtures, at the end the client sends the order, which is received by the person in charge to then be delivered to the client) in the systems engineering program; The manufacture of: Artificial snow, beer, aromatic candles, glue made from gasoline and polystyrene and copper sulfate crystals in the chemistry area; Work in conjunction with the subjects of simulation and stochastic programming to develop a holistic view on the processes in the industrial engineering program, among others.This paper describes the approach, development and results of research projects used by professors in industrial engineering, systems engineering and systems management technology programs.

Students in both the experimental and control groups showed statistically significant increases between the pre- and post-test scores (paired t-test), though the difference in the gains between the two groups was statistically insignificant as the study was underpowered. While larger trials will be needed, this work suggests that the Spatial Vis app is a promising intervention for training spatial visualization skills.", "authors": [{"name": "Elizabeth Cowan", "affiliation": "eGrove Education Inc, San Diego, CA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Gordon D.

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a \u201cfilter\u201d that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules.

Unfortunately, there are currently few tools available that make hardware security concepts accessible to introductory computer architecture students. To address this gap, We propose a new platform called TurtleMCU. TurtleMCU provides introductory students with a holistic view into the security of embedded microcontrollers, allowing them to combine reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery and exploitation, and vulnerability response and mitigation techniques at both the hardware and software level. Notably, where other environments for teaching CPU architecture or software security provide only software simulations, TurtleMCU incorporates a fully synthesizeable HDL view of a basic microprocessor, allowing students to implement the design on FPGA development platforms and incorporate their designs into real hardware and peripherals.

Whilst there is some research into this aspect in other disciplines, such as health sciences by Shulruf et al. [1], this has yet to receive appropriate attention by Engineering. We report on an analysis of the academic performance of approximately 3700 engineering students, comparing their performance in a range of subject areas (including mathematical and science foundations, advanced technical subjects, and broader professionally-focused subjects) and how this performance correlates with the breadth of their previous (secondary school) subject choices and student performances. This breadth is assessed using Schafer's measure of dispersion in categorical data [2] and secondary school subjects are categorized using the New South Wales Board of Studies subject clusters [3]. The results show a significant difference due to the greater dispersion in subject choice for students with different levels of previous academic performance at secondary schools. For students with lower secondary school performance results, an increase in diversity of secondary school subject choices leads to poorer performance in their Engineering degree programs. Conversely, for students with relatively strong secondary school performance results an increase in diversity of secondary school subject choices leads to higher performance in their Engineering degree programs.

Considering the benefits of role models and the need for terminology that supports a common understanding of role modeling, we have developed a vocabulary around this phenomenon. We aim to support educators by providing them with a means to reflect on different dimensions of role modeling. We define what a role model in engineering is, and what they may model: an aspect (a competency, a character attribute or an attitude) or an achievement. Main actors and types of awareness and intention of the modeling are covered, as well as how the modeling may be perceived by others. We indicate differences and overlaps with terms such as mentor.

Such issue in web development education is not recent and was evidenced in several studies. In a massive, open, and online context, in turn, another issue is the difficulty faced by instructors when designing competency-based activities to support the development of skills demanded by the industry, such as the use of agile practices to encourage simple, more lightweight, and faster software development. Such practices include pair-programming; sharing, discussing, and giving feedback; iterative and incremental development, among others. Believing that web development education needs further investigation, we developed a MOOC about web development that combines Bootstrap and CodeIgniter together with Agile Practices, in order to support lifelong learning in such context. Project-Based Learning was the main active learning strategy used to guide activities in the platform. The course design was based on the Learning Design Framework for MOOCs (LDF4MOOCs), an approach to design for learning that brings together important features and principles in order to provide a deeper understanding of MOOCs in the Software Engineering area and related subjects.

Current engineering education is expected to equip graduates with the skills needed to work effectively and ethically in environments characterized by social and cultural diversity. While this is commonly agreed on, adjusting program curricula to meet this need has proven to be a challenging task. To address this issue in a pragmatic way, KTH decided in 2016 to introduce an extra-curricular Certificate of Global Competence as a non-intrusive way of complementing existing programs. The certificate is made up of two courses and an international experience. This initiative has been designed to not only help students develop global competence but also to encourage and ensure quality in international mobility. As the certificate courses are elective for all programs at the university, students are presented with an opportunity to work closely together with people from different programs and backgrounds. This fosters cross-disciplinary understanding and encourages internationalization at home. The novelty of the certificate-nothing like it existed at any Swedish university-created uncertainty at the top management level. Even though one of the advantages of the certificate was the fact that it would strengthen the university's global competence education while leaving existing programs untouched, the validation process took more than two years. However, the final result, this bottom-up initiative, is now endorsed by top management and part of the university's internationalization endeavors.

Moreover, despite vocational choice and turnover having been heavily studied in the literature, few studies have examined how students' career goals relate to change in their organizational settings over time and how these perceptions then influence their turnover intentions. To fill in this research gap, this paper explores how organizational setting and respondent aspiration to be in that setting relate to turnover intentions.The paper is based on the nationally-representative, longitudinal Engineering Majors Survey and has a sample size of 350 respondents, characterized as employed and recently graduated (<;2y) from an undergraduate engineering program. Respondents are categorized in three different alignment groups (Aligned, Fluid, Unaligned) according to their career goal achievement. Respondents who are currently employed in the type of organization, they had imagined being employed at a year earlier are called Aligned. Respondents who are actually employed in the type of organization (e.g., small versus large firm) to which they stated \u201cMight or might not\u201d be employed a year earlier are classified as Fluid. Finally, respondents, who work in the organizational setting, which they did not want to work in one year prior, are called Unaligned. The paper also determines respondents turnover intentions (Stay, Flexible, Go) related to organizational settings, such as small companies or medium and large companies. Alignment and turnover groups were then compared with each other in relation to background, learning, and contextual measures. Background measures are gender, underrepresented minority status, and first generation to college status. Learning measures are internship experience, and contextual measures are job satisfaction and grade point average.The findings suggest that most of these recent graduates are Aligned and want to Stay in their organizational setting. Employees in small companies are relatively less Aligned and are more likely to Go and leave the organizational setting than are employees in large companies. Respondents who have done an internship are more often Aligned and less likely want to Go and leave their organizational setting than those who have not done an internship. These results suggest that many respondents decide before graduation on an organizational setting and continue to desire the same organizational setting after being employed for some time. Future longitudinal research should compare organizational settings-based turnover intentions with turnover intentions related to specific companies, -as a complement to much of the in literature on turnover intentions mostly refers to leaving specific organizations.", "authors": [{"name": "Sheri Sheppard", "affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Lenard Rude", "affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Shannon Gilmartin", "affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Angela Harris", "affiliation": "Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["companies", "engineering students", "employment", "fluids", "engineering profession"]}, {"title": "Using neuroeducation methods to compare engineering student performance on linear and systems tasks", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659151", "abstract": "This Research Work-in-Progress paper investigates engineering students' cognitive activities while completing linear and systems thinking tasks related to sustainability, which requires students to simultaneously utilize a large variety of constructs related to environmental, social, economic, and technical systems. To solve such interconnecting problems, systems thinking is necessary during decision-making rather than linear thinking modes that are more typical of solving closed-ended problem sets. This study uses an electroencephalogram (EEG) and self-report data to investigate engineering undergraduate students' cognitive activities when completing different tasks. We hypothesize that concept maps allow individuals to organize their thoughts within a systems thinking framework, and thus result in a more complete and holistic response than a linear thinking equivalent (i.e., listing task). We also hypothesize that creating a concept map is a more complex cognitive process than writing a list of terms and thus students (at least initially) would experience greater cognitive load while completing the concept mapping tasks.

Student motivation is vital in the learning process, and fostering it is important to promote more effective learning. Various initiatives have been proposed to increase engagement and reduce the difficulties faced by non-majors in CS1 courses. We believe that motivation can be improved by using a mix of languages and tools already tested in CS1 teaching. In this paper, we evaluate a teaching approach for non-majors, which combines the use of Scratch in a context of game creation, and Python with both turtle graphics and image manipulation. We performed an exploratory case study with CS1 civil engineering students from our institution to analyze the impact of this approach on student motivation.

Today, performance indicators are used to assess the quality of education. Often, these indicators are obtained through large scale tests applied by public assessment organizations, and their results contribute to the quality analysis of institutions, courses and students. To contribute to a more comprehensive educational assessment analysis, which considers the program content of the test items, we propose an automatic domain classification of exam questions and procedures to report results that allow a better comprehension of student performance based on the domain knowledge represented in the exam. The process starts by automatically classifying the test questions into knowledge domains using dictionaries. Using this classification, the mechanism separates the student's results by domain and generates reports that give a better understanding of the test structure and student outcome by knowledge content. This data can be used by data mining algorithms to predict student outcome in the exam based on their results during the course, allowing preventive actions to be taken to address the problems. A prototype has been implemented and is being used to classify and analyze data from the Computer Science exams of the National Examination of Student Performance (ENADE) - an exam applied in Brazil to assess the quality of all higher education institutions.

This unfairness can be present in the way software makes its decision or can limit the software functionalities to work only with certain populations.

The reasons behind these phenomena have often roots in the fact that software is created by humans who are biased and live in biased and non-inclusive environments. Recent research from the software engineering community is starting to tackle this problem at many levels from requirements analysis to the new automatic fairness testing technique (proposed first at FSE 2017 conference). However, research in bias of software is still a very undervalued and rarely discussed problem as software is often seen as a product immune to bias and non-inclusivity. This problem will be not addressed unless software engineering educators start to include this notion as a first-class problem in their foundation courses to future generation of scholars.

The key challenge for undergraduate students to appreciate software architecture design is usually their limited experience in the software industry. In software architecture, the high-level design principles are heuristics lacking the absoluteness of first principles which for inexperienced undergraduate students, this is a frustrating divergence from what they used to value. From an educator's perspective, teaching software architecture requires contending with the problem of how to express this level of abstraction practically and also make the learning realistic. In this paper, we propose a model adapting the concepts of experiential learning and risk management to design the course on software architecture. The lesson plan promotes active learning with activities to observe how different parts of an information systems architecture work, experience the impact of real software quality issues or risks arise, reflect on the root causes of these risks, conceptualize and subsequently implement the countermeasure to mitigate the risk. We divide the course into first session conducted based on the traditional lecture format and second session based on our proposed experiential risk learning model. We evaluate the feedback ratings of 128 undergraduate students of an information system program for the two sessions and perform sentiment analysis on their comments. We also generalize the applicability of our experiential risk learning model to courses in other domains of software engineering. The key contribution of this paper is the experiential risk learning model. We hope that this model alleviates the challenge to design a software architecture course for undergraduates and can be used as another teaching method for active learning.", "authors": [{"name": "Ouh Eng Lieh", "affiliation": "School of Information Systems, Singapore Management University\u00a0"}, {"name": "Yunghans Irawan", "affiliation": "Institute of Systems Science, National University of Singapore"}], "tags": ["software", "computer architecture", "risk management", "information systems", "adaptation models", "software architecture", "education"]}, {"title": "Measuring Commuter Student Support and Success through Academic", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659203", "abstract": "This Research Work In Progress Paper presents an initiative to understand engineering commuter student support and success using a validated instrument to measure academic integration. There are many calls to increase the number of engineering students who graduate with a degree; however, there is little work in uncovering the support mechanisms that work for engineering commuter students. Therefore, this WIP paper looks to start to build a case for studying engineering commuter students in more detail by first looking at differences between how residential and commuter students integrate academically. Academic integration is defined by how students are able to access, effectively interact with, and are supported by engineering faculty and staff. Academic integration is an important construct, which contributes to a student's persistence and ultimate graduation. However, it is unknown if there are differences between the way residential and commuter engineering students access the support structures provided for them. Therefore, this paper answers one research question: How do residential and commuter engineering students differ in regards to academic integration in a first-year engineering context? During the spring semester of 2018, 175 first-year engineering students participated in a questionnaire with multiple items, one of which was the construct of academic integration. I measure academic integration using the engineering student integration instrument which consists of five Likert-type questions on a six-point scale ranging from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree.'

We then modify the collaboration of the classes to mollify the barriers. After three years of collaboration, we learned that classes meeting at the same time in adjacent classrooms, so as to create time and place for teams to meet, were not sufficient to improve communication. For the collaboration within the team and the communication quality to reach parity between the disciplines, the instructors need to clearly demonstrate shared goals for the courses and create a common language by giving multiple joint lectures.", "authors": [{"name": "Wei Zhang", "affiliation": "Cognitive and Learning Sciences Department, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"}, {"name": "Robert Pastel", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["art", "teamwork", "organizations", "schedules", "education"]}, {"title": "Enhancing Electrical Science Learning Within A Novel Practice Testing Learning Framework", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659207", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel practice testing learning framework to enhance learning in electrical science. Several learning techniques are used by students to maximise their learning. Research has shown that most of those learning techniques are not effective. Retrieval practice also referred to as the 'testing effect', promotes practice testing as it is an effective technique. Accordingly, the testing effect phenomena and its potential application to electrical science education may be particularly crucial to student learning. However, research into practice testing has been limited to date in classroom contexts, and it is necessary to broaden the inquiry to enable instructors to implement practice testing as part of their teaching and learning strategy. This research seeks to address this gap by a study of n=161 apprentices on the National Electrical Apprenticeship programme in the Republic of Ireland, across multiple training centres, and how they benefited from e-assessment practice tests to enhance learning. For this purpose, a novel practice testing learning framework is applied supporting learning, item development, classification and mapping to learning outcomes. A One-Way ANOVA with the dependent variable the performance in the randomised unseen criterion test, with student test attempts as the factor found a significant improvement in performance between groups. A significant increase in performance was also evident for participants in the practice test topic not meeting the passing grade of the overall criterion test between groups with a mean performance of 72.35% following three or four practice tests compared to 52.94% with no practice tests in the practice test topic area. This finding suggests that participation in three or four practice tests enhances learning and improves self-regulation. The insights from this study will serve as guidelines for future educational research on practice testing towards enhancing learning in electrical science and other domains.", "authors": [{"name": "Pramod Pathak", "affiliation": "Department of Computing, National College of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland"}, {"name": "James Eustace", "affiliation": "Department of Computing, National College of Ireland, Dublin, Ireland\u00a0"}], "tags": ["monitoring", "testing", "cognitive processes", "schedules", "taxonomy", "task analysis", "education"]}, {"title": "Facilitating Intercultural Development: Preparing Future Engineers for Multidisciplinary Teams and Multicultural Environments", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659209", "abstract": "This innovative practice full paper describes an inclusive on-campus intercultural development program that can be applied in engineering learning environments.

Generally, study abroad programs are seen as an effective means to develop intercultural/multicultural competence. However, the opportunity to study abroad is often not accessible for all students, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. This paper describes the design, implementation, and assessment of an on campus intercultural development program, and the outcomes based on quantitative and qualitative data collected from two separate cohorts of engineering students during 2016 and 2017.

Based on the limitations in such domain, on the increasing popularity of mobile devices and on their capability to support the teaching and learning processes through their hardware specificities, in this paper we propose a catalog of gestures for mobile learning applications to be adopted in the teaching of programming. The proposed catalog also provides a way to investigate if mobile devices may motivate students to learning to programming. Four steps were conducted in this work. Firstly, primary studies that propose surface gestures interfaces were identified. Secondly, a list of main commands and programming codes were analyzed and selected to be represented by graphical gestures. Thirdly, the returned primary studies were used to propose a catalog of gestures for those code structures. With two or three possible gestures for each code structure, an evaluation to identify which of those gestures were preferred among undergraduate students was conducted. Based on the results of 69 participants, the final catalog was defined. Finally, in a fourth moment, a gesture recognition application tool was used to perform a usability evaluation. Preliminary evidences suggested the catalog can adequately support m-learning applications for the teaching of programming. Furthermore, the catalog pointed out a positive feedback that can bring a more attractive way for coding, when considered the adoption of mobile devices' small keyboards.", "authors": [{"name": "Alef Santos", "affiliation": "Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC-USP), Avenida do Trabalhador S\u00e3o\u2013Carlense,400, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Marco Schaefer", "affiliation": "Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC-USP), Avenida do Trabalhador S\u00e3o\u2013Carlense,400, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ellen F.

In traditional CS1 courses, textbook tasks are usually elementary, mathematically based, and only somewhat relevant to the student. Instead, if we allow students to design and implement their own projects, they not only master the primary objectives of the course, but they can do so in a way that is most meaningful and engaging to them. While project-based approaches to CS1 are not new, most employ predefined projects created by the instructor or found online through community-based educational resources. In this research, we leverage the fact that many CS students are double majors and allow them to create projects that are unique and applicable to these other interests. We contrast a traditionally taught CS1 class with a project-based CS1 class and compare student achievement between the two. We discover that students perform better on most learning objectives in the project-based class and they gain a deeper understanding of how to scaffold programming components into follow-on assignments.

Peer assessment is a widely used and successful method for learning in higher education, and has been extensively used in diverse fields. However, the application of this technique in computer programming courses has been limited, and typically has only been feasibly performed in online courses and provided in an online format. For those courses where students attend lectures with large class sizes, in-person peer assessment may provide a more effective technique to learn a programming language while providing the necessary feedback that instructors are not able to provide due to limited resources. As a result, the following research questions were posed: 1) is it feasible to implement inperson peer assessments of coding assignments in a large lecture based course? 2) to what extent do students and instructors find this approach acceptable? 3) do students who find peer grading acceptable improve their homework performance on coding assignments? To test the feasibility of this concept, in-person peer assessments of coding assignments were performed in a large programming course. Specifically, 118 students assessed a paper version of their peer's coding assignment. These sessions were compared to a control assignment that was not peer assessed. Quantitative as well as qualitative assessments of whether the peer assessment sessions improved students' coding abilities were analyzed. It was found that it was feasible to implement inperson peer assessment for large class sizes. From online surveys, it was found that students enjoyed the peer assessment session, and had an overall positive attitude. Finally, the positive findings on the effect of students' abilities to learn a programming language and improve their homework performance demonstrated that this technique may become an important tool to improve student learning in large lecture based programming courses. As a result, this study fills a considerable gap in the literature regarding in-person peer grading for large class sizes.

Consider the following scenario: a city located in a third world country, with one of the lowest countrywide educational performances, hosting an industrial pole based on Federal tax incentives aiming to develop a R&D cluster. The city has basic services issues, from health to urban violence, making the attraction of professionals from other locations unfeasible. As a consequence, the lack of professionals with R&D profile is now considered a relevant risk to the continuation of the city's industrial policies. Therefore, initiatives that shorten the qualification life-cycle of local professionals, while preparing senior students with real-world experience, are welcome. An example of such initiative, reported in this paper, was the software test residence, formed by professionals from the industry, and senior undergraduate and graduate students of a local university. The proposal consisted on defining a set of learning activities where students and professionals would be partners, but still being aware that they belong to different realities (with respect to timing, accountability and accreditation). The challenge can be summarized as follows: how to jointly qualify students and professionals, while respecting the peculiarities of both audiences. In order to address the issue in a short time period, representatives from a global company with R&D site in the city partnered with a local university to define a learning program inspired by the software residence approach. The university's course syllabus in Software Test was reviewed and customized to the on-the-job training subject of interest. Moreover, the approach was based on three nonnegotiable principles: Accountability, Excellence and Sustainability. The experience was successful, reaching 25 participants from four R&D organizations and the university. Results obtained include qualification of 23 participants (only two dropped off), the development of an open source educational material composed by a set of slides for testing automation classes, theory-practice of software testing targeting Test Maturity Model integration (TMMi) level 2, and the improvement in the collaboration between academia and industry for other projects.

Current engineering ethics education typically assumes that providing information about what is ethical (i.e., as explicated in ethical codes) and developing ethical reasoning skills will lead to ethical behaviors in the classroom and on the job. However, we know that people, including students and practicing engineers, sometimes engage in unethical conduct. Bandura's theory of moral disengagement explains how people disengage from their ethical principles and behave unethically. In this paper, we investigate and characterize moral disengagement among first-year engineering students. This study is based on survey and interview data collected from first-year engineering students at four U.S. universities as part of a larger longitudinal, mixed-methods research project. Our survey sample showed similar or lower moral disengagement scores as compared to other studies, while our interview data revealed how different students applied different ethical frames when evaluating moral situations and/or making moral decisions. Moreover, seven of the eight types of moral disengagement measured by the survey instrument were evident in our interview data, and we propose another mechanism called unreflective disengagement.

Students' interest in this topic has been mentioned in the Computer Science Education (CSE) field since the 1990s. Although it got the attention of computing faculty and shaped a wide number of proposals, students' disinterest remains a complex struggle in Computer Science (CS) courses. On the other hand, we still have little knowledge about what theoretical concepts and methods of research are adopted by researchers who study interest, particularly among novices in programming. As an attempt to close this gap, we carried out a systematic review process to identify frequent assumptions and methodological decisions aiming to establish a sense of what happened in the last seventeen years in this research field. Based on our review, the findings revealed that although a high number of contributions is propagated, most of them are based on lesson learned reports that fail in producing reliable evidences to substantiate the effectiveness of some proposals. The analysis of the 36 publications considered relevant to our systematic review revealed that there is not a convergent understanding between CSE researchers of what is interest and how to measure. Not many of them study interest based on specific theories or observe how students' interest changes over time. So, although we have found many publications referring to practical and experimental applications, we could see that this research area is still fragmented and led by a bit of uncertainty about what really can sustain novices more interested in learning coding.", "authors": [{"name": "Ruy Jose Barretto de Queiroz", "affiliation": "Center of Informatics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"}, {"name": "Pasqueline Dantas Scaico", "affiliation": "Department of Exact Sciences, Federal University of Paraiba, Rio Tinto, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Alexandre Scaico", "affiliation": "Center of Informatics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil\u00a0"}], "tags": ["programming profession", "proposals", "computer science education", "conferences", "systematics"]}, {"title": "Crumble Day to introduce robotics", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659256", "abstract": "Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller.

The motors and servos can be managed by Crumble. Different sensors such as the ultrasonic distance sensor, infrared distance sensor and line sensor can also be connected. In addition, Crumble can handle up to 32 RGB (Red, Green and Blue) LEDs (Light Emitter Diodes) independently and with 24-bit color resolution.

Students are often lacking these skills even though they are desired skills to have both for academic success and in the workplace. For our research, we are exploring using virtual reality to teach four professional development skills to students. These skills are leadership, teamwork, communication and ethics. We are using virtual reality as an innovative tool to teach students these skills in an interactive and fun environment. This work-in-progress paper will discuss the activities that are being developed to teach engineering students professional development skills at Iowa State University. In this paper, we will discuss three activities that are being developed to teach these four different professional development skills. Our framework for these activities is using Game Based Learning (GBL), which is based on Problem Based Learning (PBL). Each activity will be based on a problem that students must work together to solve. Through this interaction, students will learn one or more of the professional development skills outlined in this paper. The goals and learning outcomes of each activity will then be outlined and discussed in more detail. We will outline the execution of each activity and how the interaction between the students and the virtual reality system will be accomplished. In this paper, we will show our current work in progress of the development of the game environment used in these activities. This will include screen shots and other examples of the game environment for each activity. The development platform used for these activities is the Unity platform, a free game development software package that includes tools for working with virtual reality. The virtual reality headset that will be used with Unity will be the HTC Vive. This allows us to have an interactive environment where students can see and hear in the virtual space and use controllers to interact with objects in the virtual space. We are also adding physical props that can interact with the virtual space. The addition of these props is designed to allow multiple players to be involved while keeping costs low and increasing the portability of the system.", "authors": [], "tags": ["virtual reality", "tools", "teamwork", "engineering students", "ethics", "games"]}, {"title": "Examination the impact of various factors on student success in an introduction to circuit analysis course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659259", "abstract": "In this work in progress, several models to predict student success in a sophomore introduction to circuit analysis class were created based on prior grade point average, grade in a pre-requisite physics class, the semester the pre-requisite physics class was taken, the number of units a student was taking, the number of times a student repeated the circuits class, and the number of times a student repeated any class prior to enrollment.

Researchers are also pointing out the importance of hackathons as an informal learning approach for college students. The acquisition of knowledge comes as a result of the practice itself and with participants learning from one another. This motivated us to bring that practice to the classroom, by offering an undergraduate course where students develop their semester project within a hackathon. In an attempt to systematize the steps, compress and optimize the time allocated for the ideation phase of hackathon projects, we propose a methodology for hackathons in an educational setting. The approach combines concepts from Challenge-based Learning and Design Thinking in a sequence of activities that streamlines the ideation process with regular deliveries in short time frames. This results in objective discussions and quick decision taking, fastly arriving at a project idea where students apply what they learned over the semester.

Even though there has been some computing educational research work on the topic of data privacy at the K-12 level, the visual privacy theme under the societal and human security domain has hardly been explored within K-12. None of the K-12 cybersecurity educational modules have employed the privacy-enhanced computer vision theme along with a social media platform. This paper intends to address the this gap by presenting a visual privacy themed lesson plan using social media apps for teaching privacy, ethics and machine learning. Its main contribution is a unique visual privacy education based hands-on outreach module that utilizes the PVA (Privacy through Visual Anonymity) notion to teach privacy, ethics and machine learning using media images and videos. Our module uses two freely accessible apps, namely an Obscura Cam and YouTube - Face Blur. These apps are utilized to illustrate the concept of visual privacy and demonstrate PVA in pictures and media clips. Additionally, this paper describes our research case study conducted by piloting our PVA workshop module at the middle-school level. This paper discusses and analyzes the learner data obtained from the workshop participants as part of our Google IgniteCS outreach project. The learning analytics survey data collected during our PVA workshop sessions with various middle-school participants indicate that the described visual privacy module can become a simple yet effective tool for privacy literacy, as it can help build privacy perceptions in young minds. Our acquired results also suggest that that this PVA themed outreach lesson plan can be used as a potential medium for recruiting K-12 students into computing and cybersecurity disciplines.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Ulman", "affiliation": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, United States\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ankur Chattopadhyay", "affiliation": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, United States\u00a0"}, {"name": "Caleb Sawyer", "affiliation": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, United States"}, {"name": "David Christian", "affiliation": "Department of Information and Computing Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, United States\u00a0"}], "tags": ["visualization", "machine learning", "youtube", "computer security", "privacy"]}, {"title": "Shift in Mid-Year Engineering Students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Perceptions of Their Future Careers Over Time", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659279", "abstract": "This full research paper presents a pilot study exploring how mid-year engineering students' perceptions of their future careers shift over one academic year.

Personalized learning is gaining popularity in online computer science education due to its characteristics of pacing the learning progress and adapting the instructional approach to each individual learner from a diverse background. Among various instructional methods in computer science education, hands-on labs have unique requirements of understanding learner's behavior and assessing learner's performance for personalization. However, it is rarely addressed in existing research. In this paper, we propose a personalized learning platform called ThoTh Lab specifically designed for computer science hands-on labs in a cloud environment. ThoTh Lab can identify the learning style from student activities and adapt learning material accordingly. With the awareness of student learning styles, instructors are able to use techniques more suitable for the specific student, and hence, improve the speed and quality of the learning process. With that in mind, ThoTh Lab also provides student performance prediction, which allows the instructors to change the learning progress and take other measurements to help the students timely. For example, instructors may provide more detailed instructions to help slow starters, while assigning more challenging labs to those quick learners in the same class. To evaluate ThoTh Lab, we conducted an experiment and collected data from an upper-division cybersecurity class for undergraduate students at Arizona State University in the US. The results show that ThoTh Lab can identify learning style with reasonable accuracy. By leveraging the personalized lab platform for a senior level cybersecurity course, our lab-use study also shows that the presented solution improves students engagement with better understanding of lab assignments, spending more effort on hands-on projects, and thus greatly enhancing learning outcomes.", "authors": [{"name": "Chun-Jen Chung", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Duo Lu", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Yuli Deng", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Zhen Zeng", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA"}, {"name": "Dijiang Huang", "affiliation": "School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["cloud computing", "data mining", "computer science", "computer science education", "computer security", "virtual machining"]}, {"title": "Uncovering the Hidden Factors that Could Compromise Equitable and Effective Engineering Education", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659294", "abstract": "Literacies are central to the social and cultural practices that are intertwined with identities, who gets to participate in engineering, and the knowledge that is valued in the discipline.

This effort is motivated, in part, by the perspective that the first year of engineering at the university level can be a source of hardship for many students. Not only are they navigating a new environment away from home, but they are also often experiencing new educational challenges that can push them to re-evaluate their identities with respect to smartness and becoming an engineer. We are interested in understanding how students construct and tell stories about their life experiences as learners and how these stories provide insight to their beliefs about smartness and their related identities as students or as engineers. Because these constructs are complex and overlapping, we conducted narrative-style interviews with students who self-identified as having an interesting story to tell about an educational struggle during their first year in an undergraduate engineering program. We are motivated to answer the following research questions: In what ways do narrative style interviews provide insight into complex constructs related to beliefs about smartness and identity? How do first-year engineering students describe their educational experiences with respect to smartness and identity? To scope our work, we frame beliefs about smartness through the use of Dweck`s mindset theory, and for identity, we use Gee`s identity lens coupled with Godwin`s definition of engineering student identity.

This shows that awareness is the first issue that should be tackled in our outreach. The outreach team unanimously agreed on executing an outreach camp which is designed to familiarize JC students on three main aspects; the value of IS in solving real world problems, common IS topics and IS related jobs. We have executed several outreach camps since our first run and have observed significant improvements in the number and quality of applications.

The dominant argument suggests that by engaging in real world projects and research, students can acquire valuable critical thinking, team work, problem-solving, and improved communication skills. The aim of this work-in-progress paper is to investigate the effects of PBL on student performance in a requirements engineering (RE) course. Students were divided into 5 project groups; each group carried out a RE project that addresses a real-world problem. The project deliverable for each group is a complete software requirements specification (SRS) document; a user interface design; and software development project management plan. Following the completion of the project, structured feedback was elicited from the students via questionnaires. The results were combined with the final student grades to evaluate the effect of PBL on their combined performance. Preliminary results show that PBL can benefit RE courses, especially by enhancing students performance. Yet, certain challenges, e.g., stakeholders engagement and team cohesion, must be addressed before these benefits can be fully realized.", "authors": [{"name": "Joshua C.

Firstly, the lectures were moved online but instead of covering one topic and all the sub-topics in one video we covered each sub-topic in a separate video. This resulted in four to five videos a week between five to ten minutes. The shorter videos ensure that students learn the individual sub-topics before their attention gets divided. The classroom time was spent in relating the theory taught in the videos to practical real-life applications, live demonstrations of the concepts as well as solving mathematical tutorials. Secondly, a graded online quiz is conducted every two or three weeks that tests students on the video's contents.

Examining the intersection of aspirations and attitudes allows educators to understand how students' intended career choices are related to their perceptions of their educational experience. Using survey data from 2,916 students at four large public universities, we found that an interest in industry-based careers was associated with high engineering identity, belongingness, and motivation scores. We found that gender had a moderate effect on aspirations and attitudes. Additionally, we found that an interest in mechanical engineering was associated with increased certainty in an engineering/industry career, while interests in biomedical engineering, non-engineering STM majors, and non-STEM majors were associated with decreased certainty in an engineering/industry career.

This paper contributes to the philosophy of engineering education by proposing a strategic initiative to bridge the Gap. The expected outcomes of the proposed initiative are the following: Reclassification of the majors available in engineering schools and redesigning the knowledge taught in these schools to match industry needs. These outcomes could be achieved by firstly giving engineers the opportunity to write about their own experience at an industry level in engineering journals and, through their writing, schools get an idea of what is going on in the industry. Secondly, accrediting agencies such as ABET should grant a higher rank to engineering schools based on what they have done over time to bridge the Gap.

We have developed a rubric for assessing results of this exercise that can be used to both assess participants' facility with forming connections and as the basis for a conversation with students about how to make more meaningful connections. Further, faculty can use this activity to stimulate students' idea generation about course topics. We have tested this approach in two settings, and find initial results promising.

Low student access to feedback, delivered through a learning management system (LMS), was seen as a considerable learning opportunity loss. Negative binomial regression models were used to investigate whether semester (2016 or 2017) and refection (presence or absence) had an impact on the (1) number of days students accessed the LMS gradebook or rubrics, (2) the number of times students accessed the gradebook to view grades, or (3) the number of times students accessed rubrics to view feedback. Semester, which relates to implementation changes in the SBG system, significantly increased students' number of days of access and number of gradebook and rubric accesses.

Key stakeholders, including leading scientists, universities and funding agencies, have promoted computational modeling to enable life sciences research and improve the translation of genetic and molecular biology high-throughput data into clinical results. Software platforms to facilitate computational modeling by biologists who lack advanced mathematical or programming skills have had some success, but none has achieved widespread use among life scientists. Because computational modeling is a core engineering skill of value to other STEM fields, it is critical for engineering and computer science educators to consider how we help students from across STEM disciplines learn computational modeling. Currently we lack sufficient research on how best to help life scientists learn computational modeling.To address this gap, in 2017, we observed a short-format summer course designed for life scientists to learn computational modeling. The course used a simulation environment designed to lower programming barriers. We used semi-structured interviews to understand students' experiences while taking the course and in applying computational modeling after the course. We conducted interviews with graduate students and post-doctoral researchers who had completed the course. We also interviewed students who took the course between 2010 and 2013. Among these past attendees, we selected equal numbers of interview subjects who had and had not successfully published journal articles that incorporated computational modeling. This Work-in-Progress paper applies social cognitive theory to analyze the motivations of life scientists who seek training in computational modeling and their attitudes towards computational modeling. Additionally, we identify important social and environmental variables that influence successful application of computational modeling after course completion. The findings from this study may therefore help us educate biomedical and biological engineering students more effectively.Although this study focuses on life scientists, its findings can inform engineering and computer science education more broadly.

Pedagogical design patterns provide faculty with combinations of generalized descriptions of problems and solutions that occur in teaching and learning. The benefit of forming design patterns is the codification of successful practice that can be reused in multiple scenarios and draw on the creativity of the instructor for defining the details relevant to the course and the students. Design patterns have been represented in many formats since Alexander's initial design pattern model highlighting different aspects of what is important in each domain in which the patterns are created and used. This paper analyzes design patterns emerging from recent developments in lecture-based pedagogy and active learning in CS education. Traditional lectures in computer science, engineering, and other STEM disciplines are being reconsidered due to research that shows that students are less likely to learn while listening and more likely to learn while actively engaged. Design patterns that address problems and provide potential solutions to traditional lectures in computer science education have been published that provide solutions to engage students during the lecture. The pedagogy of flipped classrooms and active learning have recently been adopted by many faculty in Computer Science leading to emerging design patterns for active learning. We compare how previously published lecture-based patterns and our active learning patterns address similar problems with different solutions to engaging students. We show how an object-based structure for pedagogical design patterns can provide additional information about the problems and the solutions addressed by the patterns that are more easily indexed and combined.", "authors": [{"name": "Mary Lou Maher", "affiliation": "Department. of Software & Information Systems, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Nasrin Dehbozorgi", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Mohsen Dorodchi", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, USA"}, {"name": "Stephen MacNeil", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["creativity", "teamwork", "computer science", "conferences", "computational modeling", "education"]}, {"title": "Collaborative Learning in MOOCs Approaches and Experiments", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8659340", "abstract": "This Research-to-Practice paper examines the practical application of various forms of collaborative learning in MOOCs.

An examination of the academic job market reveals that a significant number of institutions are looking to hire new faculty in the area of cybersecurity. Additionally, a growing number of universities are starting to offer courses, certifications and degrees in cybersecurity. Other recent activity includes the development of a model cybersecurity curriculum and the creation of a program accreditation criteria for cybersecurity through ABET. This sudden and significant growth in demand for cybersecurity expertise has some similarities to the significant demand for networking faculty that Computer Science programs experienced in the late 1980s as a result of the rise of the Internet. This paper examines the resources necessary to respond to the demand for cybersecurity courses and programs and draws some parallels and distinctions to the demand for networking faculty over 25 years ago. Faculty and administration are faced with a plethora of questions to answer as they approach this problem: What degree and courses to offer, what certifications to consider, which curriculum to incorporate and how to deliver the material (online, faceto-face, or something in-between)?

While, in theory, the process of evaluating learning outcomes appears to be trivial, in practice it is a complicated and daunting process. In this study, we evaluate how learning outcomes can be effectively applied. The work focuses on the quality of both the specification of the learning outcomes and the assessment of whether these outcomes are reached. We discuss different abstraction levels for learning outcomes and the issue of alignment between high-level and low-level learning outcomes. We also address the criteria for assessing whether a student is meeting a learning outcome. Our work is focused on project-oriented courses, where assessing learning outcomes is seen as particularly challenging. In particular, we draw on an empirical study focused on systematically collecting key performance indicators of the progress towards achieving learning outcomes. The data gathering was done during the course through in-class questionnaires and individual diary notes, as a complementary process to the traditional observations made by the teacher running the course. This data serves as the basis for understanding how individual students advance towards the stated learning goals. We also conducted a focus group discussion after the course to better understand how to interpret the data collected during the course. An important result of our work is forming an understanding and vocabulary regarding learning outcomes and the assessment of how well students meet these learning goals in project-based educational settings.

The ambient intelligent system coordinates the interaction between all the students and teacher who is present in class. A real-time machine learning application to detect learners' levels of attention and participation makes use of sensory data generated together with other learning data collected from the portal that collectively assists in the learning analysis process that is looped back to the learners' learning environment, as well as to the educator, in an attempt to improve the delivery and the entire educational process.

Six univariate ANOVAS, each two by two, crossed two independent variables (gender of the participant and cue prompt gender) to produce four experimental conditions. Results revealed negative affect vs. positive affect responses to the cue. The females in the story received more negative responses by men, and the men coded more negative overall.

The service life of Corrugated Steel Pipe (CSP) culverts is largely dictated by the loss of wall section of pipe arising from corrosion. This corrosion is due to chemical and electrochemical processes based on two major factors: pH levels and the resistivity of the soil. Service life estimates are based on several additional factors: potential for culvert abrasion, changing soil moisture, temperature conditions, soil moisture content, presence of chloride in the soil, and proximity of lakes, wetlands, or marine environments. In addition to pH and resistivity, the CSUN Caltrans Research team has added culvert thickness loss, sulfate and chloride content, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, and land use. The thickness reader allows the CSUN Caltrans Research team to calculate the loss of metal from the CSP culverts' nominal thickness. The goal of this research is to improve the existing service life equations which is currently used by the California Department of Transportation and its associated test methods.
