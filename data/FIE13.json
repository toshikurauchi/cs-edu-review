First, most modeling tools used seemingly esoteric notations that were hurdles for many students. Even if the notation could be tamed, the tools themselves were rarely more than syntax checkers, possibly with support for simple expression evaluation. Venturing beyond this requires understanding of proof theories and strategies well beyond that typical of other engineering disciplines. What is more, the tools worked at a much lower level than that of the domain itself; it was easy for students to miss the forest for the trees. The development and release of the Alloy from MIT has improved the situation dramatically. With Alloy, instructors now have a tool that supports formal structural and behavioral modeling (using C-like syntax), along with state space exploration and property verification using relational logic, predicates, and assertions The tradeoff involved - only first order systems over finite domains can be analyzed - is not problematic in practice. The workshop will introduce Alloy - both the language and support tool - to faculty interested in formal methods and mathematical modeling. After a brief introduction to Alloy concepts, the tool and language will be explored by interactively developing a simple software system model.

To assess this need, two research questions are addressed: 1) What elements of a motivation instrument designed for first-year engineering students are valid for upper-level engineering students? 2) How do motivations differ for upper level students in different engineering majors? Students in their major-specific engineering courses were surveyed with the Motivation and Attitudes in Engineering (MAE) instrument, which assesses long-term goal related expectancy, and perceptions of present and future tasks/goals. Short-term task self-efficacy was assessed using items adapted from the Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving survey. Results based on comparisons between major, class, and grade point average (GPA) showed: 1) Higher GPA indicates significantly higher expectancies and self-efficacy; 2) Bioengineers have significantly higher expectancies than mechanical engineers; and 3) Juniors have significantly higher GPAs, expectancies, and more positive perceptions of the present than sophomores.

Efforts aimed at addressing this need vary broadly from increasing the public's awareness of the problem, to re-framing the identity of engineering, de-emphasizing its less glamorous aspects, and orienting engineering's future toward solving the world's greatest problems facing humanity. In doing so, it is suggested that engineering would be a more appealing profession to groups that are historically under-represented. The fundamental assumption of these efforts is that an improved image of engineering as a socially engaged helper of humanity will result in greater initial and prolonged interest in engineering. Research investigating engineering as a profession has found few examples of specific engineering disciplines considered socially sensitive. This may suggest engineering is a career choice better aligned with individuals who prefer working with things rather than people.

It is difficult to evaluate when to teach parallelism and how to change the paradigm from serial to parallel algorithm in traditional curricula. Currently, there are efforts to introduce parallel programming since there are multi-core processors. However, there is a new chip generation called many-core processor. For instance, one processor chip can be built with 1,000 processing cores. Moreover, this type of processor is designed to achieve scalability and performance based on heterogeneous cores. How to teach parallelism to undergraduate and graduate students? Human resources are necessary to design and program parallel architectures based on this next generation of many-core processor. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to show an experience based on research projects. The idea is to join students from different courses and levels, e.g. Computer Science, Information Systems, Computer Engineering, and Graduate in Informatics. All of them working together in order to understand all characteristics of heterogeneous many-core processors based on integrated environment composed of computer clusters and simulation. The proposed method focuses on projects convergence to teach how to extract characteristics from benchmark traces in order to simulate many-core processors based on Networks-on-Chip. Consequently, students can understand parallel heterogeneous architectures and how to program them. Main results present the number of students interested in this research field along last three years and several scientific papers published.

After the validation of the sample adequacy, the factor analysis validate the structure of the questionnaire, and we can state that the SEEQ instrument is valid for application in a teleinformatics engineering context to analyze the disciplines. As a final result of this procedure, we guarantee the consistency of the instrument for the application to analyze different disciplines under different criterions that can possibility a deeper analysis of the curriculum structure.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomaz E.

This discussion aims to propose a mathematical model to support the academic management, based on multivariate analysis (MVA) and data processing, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The instrument created aims to identify professors' point of view about the management practices developed in their academic courses where they work. The application of the reliability tests revealed the suitability of the sample for the application of PCA. In the PCA application, we observed the formation of three responses' clusters, that has been well characterized by the similarity of their factor loadings that are related to students' academic education, academic formation processes and institutional environment.

This paper presents an educational software application for multi-touch tablet devices to support dimensioning activities. Our application uses a multi-touch interface where students can create 2D parametric drawings with dimensions using freehand sketches and receive feedback from the system about the quality of their dimensioning exercises. When a student finishes a sketch, the system reports back the correct and incorrect dimensions. Multi-touch gestures are also used for basic sketch manipulation (panning, zooming, and rotating), similar to the standard functionality found in modern smart phones and tablets.

The computer-based nature for LOs allows for sophisticated tracking that can collect metadata about the individual learners. This tends to result in a tremendous amount of metadata collected on LOs. The challenge becomes identifying the predictors of learning. Previous research tends to be focused on a single area of metadata such as the learning strategies or demographic variables. Here we report on a comprehensive regression analysis conducted on variables in four widely different areas including LO interaction data, MSLQ survey responses (that measure learning strategies), demographic information, and LO evaluation survey data. Our analysis found that a subset of the variables in each area were actually significant predictors of learning. We also found that several static variables that appeared to be significant predictors in their own right were simply reflecting the results from student motivation. These results provide valuable insights into which variables are significant predictors.

Four teams of students working on the regenerative community and four teams of students working on a more traditional capstone design project completed proposals and their first progress reports during the Fall 2012 semester. The Comprehensive Assessment of Team-Member Effectiveness (CATME) instrument was administered twice during the semester to evaluate team functioning. A comparison of the data for the two capstone projects is presented. Results from these surveys indicate students working on the regenerative community project were more positive and consistent with the behavioral and satisfaction categories within the peer evaluation survey.", "authors": [{"name": "Damon R.

Despite numerous studies of effective approaches to integrating communication into disciplinary courses, few engineering courses apply those approaches. To address this gap, we have undertaken a multi-year mixed methods study to explore faculty and student beliefs about communication. Faculty beliefs have been reported elsewhere; this paper focuses on student beliefs. We analyzed five focus groups conducted with engineering students at partner schools. The focus groups sought to uncover students' beliefs about where and how they learned communication skills within their engineering education. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim, then coded using standard open-coding procedures. The findings indicate that while students do have opportunities to practice communication in engineering courses, they may not always have optimal opportunities to learn communication in those courses. Most notably, students desired more examples and direct instruction for communication skills, including not only samples of \u201cgood\u201d documents but also explanations about why they were good.

Qualitative data (interviews) suggest that students grasp the value of heterogeneous groups and are able to recognize the gains of such diversity. We are interested in the relationship between learning styles and team dynamics in advanced chemical engineering students taking the team-based unit operations course. We are looking to correlate team composition with respect to learning styles preferences with team performance and student perceptions of team efficacy. Students are given a learning styles questionnaire to determine preferences in the course's lecture portion. These are used to identify potential correlations between team make-up, team performance and student perceptions during the subsequent laboratory portion.

Primary data consist of 90-minute semi-structured interviews of eight team members and one non-member. By interpreting the narrative portraits of two female students, we show the construction of a team culture where in general women are discouraged from participation based on stereotyped gender roles, by night campus attitudes, and by peers who challenge or ignore their skills, contributions, and interests. One woman persevered through the male-dominated culture because she received the encouragement and support of male peers who engaged as comrades and champions.

To improve students performance in the classroom, many techniques have been developed to address these variances. The computing fields, however, tend to have a large percentage of students who are visual learners. These students learn best by seeing, and they can perform very well in the classroom with the appropriate usage of teaching styles. However, when it comes to providing feedback to students on submitted assignments, the main method employed is the written comment, which is not conducive to visual learners. This method is most prevalent in the academic community because overall, it is the simplest form of feedback that a faculty member can provide to students. However, written feedback is often highly ineffective at improving student performance, as many students simply do not read the comments because the students feel they are not relevant to their performance. This paper presents an assessment of an alternative method for providing feedback to students: video feedback. In lieu of written feedback, students are provided feedback for software engineering exercises through the use of a short video made via video capture. The video captures in multimedia format the instructors perceptions and actions when grading a given assignment. The video includes both aural commentary as the assignment is assessed, as well as dynamic visuals of the grading process, demonstrating failures and improvements that can be made in the submitted assignment.

In light of this, two approaches to mitigating concurrency problems are immutable variables and state isolation within distinct concurrent actors.

We analyzed student scores from 2006, 2009, and 2012 years respectively and categorized them by declared major. In this assignment, we asked our students to calculate the amount of energy that they consumed in one week of their life in college and identify the activities that consumed the largest amount of energy. We also asked them if they would consider any habit changes after completing this assignment. The goal of this assignment was to introduce non-science and engineering students to the concepts of energy, power, electricity, heat, temperature, first and second laws of thermodynamics, embedded energy and world energy consumption. The most common categories included; energy consumed in heating up water, transportation, and electricity. Additionally, on calculating energy used by electricity, we asked the students to confirm their calculations by reading labels and using Kill-a-Watt reading devices. In total, the scores of more than 500 students were evaluated. We found that the average of the scores increased by 19% between 2006 and 2012, and by 14% between 2009 and 2012. Since we used a similar rubric for grading, this shows that the students were able to perform better as we provided more step-by-step instructions, and streamlined the lectures on basic physics and energy concepts in the first three weeks of the course. Moreover, we grouped the student's scores by their declared major. The four categories were engineering, social sciences, natural sciences, and undecided/other majors. We found that in 2006 the students with social science majors on average received the highest scores and in 2009 the students with natural science majors received the highest scores.

In order to enhance student learning in this course, we offered an additional hands-on laboratory experiment on concentrating solar power. The laboratory kit consisted of affordable and widely available materials that included 24 telescoping mirrors, stands, steel cup, thermometer, timer, and a cup of water. We asked the students to design, assemble, and test a central receiver concentrator with the goal to boil water contained in a steel cup. Upon achieving this goal, students were then asked to calculate the efficiency, define losses, and recommend ways of increasing efficiencies and therefore improving their systems through. The design challenge for the students is to determine the optimum position for the mirrors. Additionally, we asked the students to comment on the following; the effects of the time of the day and weather conditions, direct commercial applications, the process of generating electricity from solar concentrators. In order to record the level of improvement, each student was given the same questionnaire before and after completing the laboratory experiment.

The system's ability to provide immediate and quality feedback to both students and instructors, particularly in large classes, is highly desirable. While CRS has been used for well over a decade and been shown to successfully improve student engagement and participation, a number of studies have also identified that its use could potentially mean that less material is able to be covered in lectures. Clearly, the approach of cramming CRS into already content-heavy class time does not embrace the potential for CRS to improve student engagement and student learning. The use of CRS should be planned as an integral component of the course which enhances and reinforces the learning outcomes. The effectiveness of CRS depends strongly on the quality and variety of the questions, and the design of the activities to encourage students to engage with the questions. This case study explores the use of a new, low-cost, state-ofthe-art CRS (Top Hat Monocle) which allows students to use their mobile devices (phones, tablets, laptops) to respond to a variety of numerical, multiple-choice, short-answer and open-ended discussion questions posed during face-to-face workshops. In order to allow sufficient time to fully engage with the workshop activities traditional lectures were revised and the classroom lecture was flipped. Students worked through narrated lecture material (hand-e-lectures) online, prior to attending the workshops. CRS was included as part of the e-lecture content and feedback from this was incorporated into the workshops. Workshops extended the e-lecture content by including a variety of carefully designed, engaging activities (many were group activities) that used CRS questions to facilitate discussions, problem solving and case study analysis to enhance student cognition.

At the University of Portland, we have resurrected and enhanced a hands-on advanced CAD and automated manufacturing course that introduces students to advanced solid modeling techniques in CAD, such as sweeps, lofts, and surfacing methods. In addition, students learn manual machining and vacuum forming in our machine shop, along with learning how to create tool paths for CNC machining their designed CAD parts out of wax on various three axis end mills, a 3D printer, and a 3D laser scanner. The end mills were all refurbished and/or repaired over a period of four years to get this course up and running. A commercial software package, MasterCAM, was used in conjunction with SolidWorks as the platform from which to learn about automated manufacturing. In addition, a MakerBot 3D printer was built from a kit to give students experience with future manufacturing techniques. The 3D laser scanner was student designed and built and creates CAD surface models of parts, useful for learning about reverse engineering. The machinable wax used for machining is recycled, melted down, and formed into blocks again for reuse. This saves considerable money. Our goal has been to enhance design quality in our curriculum through experiential learning. Prior to taking this course, all mechanical engineering students are required to take a solid modeling CAD course to learn the basics. However, our experience has been that students do not conceptually understand the importance of designing for manufacture. Although emphasized in all courses, without the hands-on experience, it is difficult for students to remember to apply fillet radii to the bottom of pockets, for example. When faced with having to fit a block with sharp corners into a machined pocket with its default small corner radii, however, learning is instantaneous.

At this stage, each student could interact with a group of up to ten students that acted as advisers. The adopted assessment process is based on the model proposed by Savi [7]. Then, at the end of the game, the students answered a prepared questionnaire based on the model proposed by Savi. According to Savi, although there are significant studies that show the importance of educational games for the process of cognitive development and learning concepts of students, there are few papers that present forms of assessing the potential of these resources. Thus, the assessment criteria proposed by Savi are based on the model of training evaluation by Kirkpatrick [3], taken as a reference to measure the efficiency of processes of continuing education courses for professionals. The authors assert that the metric of the evaluation proposed to assess the game is based on the first level of the model proposed by Kirkpatrick.", "authors": [{"name": "Mauricio P.

One attempt to overcome it is the adoption of Learning Object Repositories (LOR), in order to smooth LO manipulation experiences for teachers and content authors. Some of its keys characteristics are: to promote LO dissemination and reuse to users in a unified spot; and, to serve LO through flexible searches and enforce a metadata standard classification. This paper proposes an innovative repository model to support LOR and their use in web-based courses in the context of an specific LMS, the Moodle environment.

Therefore, we work hard to help our students master often-difficult concepts; however, our evaluation of their conceptual understanding often occurs simultaneously with evaluation of other learning goals through use of traditional problem-solving tests. Seldom do we measure pre-to-post learning gains. Often, instruments that would facilitate pre-to-post learning evaluation are not available. Creation, development, and use of such instruments would likely promote constructive conversations between engineering students and faculty members. Assessment instruments that have been designed to evaluate only conceptual understanding are often referred to as concept inventories, following a convention established by the Force Concept Inventory. Concept inventories have a range of possible uses, e.g., a pre-course diagnostic to understand conceptual understanding of students at the beginning of a course, early course formative assessment to guide instructional planning, summative assessment to evaluate conceptual understanding at the end of the course, and pre-post assessment to aid evaluation of instructional strategies. Concept inventories have been used at both course and program levels. What distinguishes concept inventories from typical engineering course assessment methods is focus on a small set of key constructs, focus on a specific domain of academic content, and focus on conceptual understanding or qualitative reasoning, as opposed to computational problem solving. Considerable scholarship informs selection of the situations, formulation of the question, and development of plausible distracters. During the workshop, participants will (i) be provided an overview of research on conceptual understanding, (ii) be provided an overview of the historical development of concept inventories, (iii) engage in activities to describe effective uses and some misuses of concept inventories in their courses, (iv) learn how to access existing concept inventories via the developing ciHUB.org platform, (v) discuss psychometric properties of existing instruments, (vi) learn how psychometric analysis can aid development of concept inventories, and (vii) have opportunities to become active members in a growing community of users.", "authors": [{"name": "P.

The issue is further compounded by the sky-rocketing cost of education-students and families want an acceptable rate of return on their tuition.

Engineering education and team literature is replete with theoretical and descriptive studies focused on adding separate team-building courses to the already full and expensive mandatory class lists.

Therefore, it was imperative to distinguish the PEOs from the ABET student outcomes since the PEOs must quantify the expected attainments of graduates a few years after graduation. First, PEOs must reflect the Mission Statement of the institution and serve as a yardstick of student achievement three to five years following graduation. The objectives represent the expectations of the department from its graduates. Active participation by the faculty in defining the PEOs yield clear and concise objectives and promotes ownership of the goals of the Department and ABET process. However, not all faculty members are necessarily familiar with the assessment language and the process to evaluate the PEOs.

This dominant worldview forms the frame of reference for a collectivity of people, such as a nation or culture. In this paper, we attempt to articulate modern worldviews, the contemporary engineering worldview, and the sustainability worldview. We use the concept of worldviews to address the compatibility of sustainability and engineering. Our synthesis suggests that the two ideologies are misaligned and incompatible in many respects.

The focus of the course is how the built environment influences the social, economic, and natural environment. Engineering decisions about the materials used to create the built environment affect structural integrity, energy performance, and the sense of place in cities. These factors, in turn, affect the quality of life for all citizens - so the topic of this course is of interest to students of all disciplines. As such it offers an opportunity to introduce non-engineering students to the way that engineers think and make decisions. The second topic is an exploration of why engineering departments are not typically major players in General Education. We in engineering have often secluded ourselves from the rest of the university. The effect of this is that students outside of engineering view the subject matter as out of reach when many of the main ideas are really central to the shared life of our nation.

Flipping the classroom switches when assignments (e.g. homework) and knowledge transfer (e.g. lecture) occur. Flipped classrooms are getting popular in secondary and post-secondary teaching institutions as evidenced by the marked increase in the study, use, and application of the flipped pedagogy as it applies to learning and retention. The majority of the courses that have undergone this change use applied learning strategies and include a significant \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d component. The research in this area is skewed towards such courses and in general there are many considerations that educators ought to account for if they were to move to this form of teaching.

This paper will examine the following: The liberating essence of engineering education is the practical/pragmatic elements of engineering. The liberation is achieved by injecting pragmatism into engineering education. Changing our pedagogical approaches can do this liberation. We should help our students to use their knowledge gained from mathematics, sciences, and other fields to focus on making, building, examining, designing, and inventing things. Liberations for engineering come out of making change by designing, building, and inventing. This is the main missing piece of most engineering curricula.

The paper reviews distinct directions and curriculum trends that dominate engineering education and will raise the main question: \u201cWhat makes engineering special and different from sciences and mathematics?\u201d The paper provides the support for this argument by examining the main trends of engineer development to prove that the practical/pragmatic aspects of the engineering fields are the true essence that uniquely distinguishes the engineering education. Consequently, the pragmatic essence of engineering (which needs to be reflected in the engineering education) has been (and must be) the unique identifier and the liberating element of the engineering curricula. The idea of liberation is meant as a guiding concept to help educators reflect on pragmatic essence of engineering when balancing between mathematical rigor, scientific basics, engineering systems level thinking, and identifying a common knowledge base and methodologies.", "authors": [{"name": "Mani Mina", "affiliation": "Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

This WIP paper describes what was perceived as the main frontiers in each of four periods corresponding to the four decades since the first conference by examining papers from two sample conferences in each decade. In addition to a careful analysis of selected FIE Proceedings, results of a brief survey of long-time FIE leaders and more recent participants are presented as further evidence on identifying the recognized frontiers for each period. Changes during the intervening years of the conference included more formal presentations, required reviews before accepting papers, and references to clearly show the relevance of each paper within the body of knowledge. Currently, papers are categorized as innovative practice, research-to-practice, or research; an emphasis on STEM research nationally has created engineering education departments within universities. Faculty and staff from these departments regularly present their research results at FIE Conferences. The overall goal for conference organizers and program chairs is to make certain not only that accepted papers point to existing frontiers as the major focus of the FIE Conference each year but also include invited speakers, sessions, panels, and keynote addresses that focus on other emerging frontiers.", "authors": [{"name": "James R.

The best way to achieve the course requirements is to use the constructivist activities, let the students individually or collaboratively to work with the relevant partners and build the required knowledge and skills gradually. An assignment was developed which requires the students to investigate different aspects of an enterprise website. To complete this assignment, the students need to use an inquiry based learning approach. The practice is evaluated by using a set of survey data, a set of data observed from the marking reports and the industry feedbacks.

While the experiences within a student's research group defined a clear evaluation pathway, a second pathway characterizing student attitudes shaped by the REU community at-large also emerged. This created an interesting question on the effects direct observation has on evaluation data. In response the REMRSEC REU SEP evaluation plan saw different implementations from 2011 to 2012.

In this work, the goal is to extend our exploration of how mind maps can be automatically analyzed using their graph properties to reflect student learning. In particular, a set of student mind maps are created three times during a class in both 2011 and 2012 on digital system design using a common technical vocabulary. These mind maps are analyzed by extracting graph metrics by comparison with a criterion mind map, which is an expert created mind map. The metrics are derived from traditional graph metrics (average degree and graph density), three sets of difference metrics analyzed with a internally created tool, and a graph metric invented for comparing proteins. The results of this exploratory analysis is that five of the six metrics can be used to evaluate if a student is learning and connecting the vocabulary in a given subject over time. Additionally, these five metrics are correlated to one another. This result is promising, but we emphasize that these metrics do not correlate directly to class performance based on student grades over the course, and therefore, the current goal for this measurement technique is to be used to provide the student with automated feedback on their mind maps as related to the technical vocabulary of a course. This work extends our original work by increasing the number of graph metrics that are used to automatically analyze student maps to a criterion map. The idea is to find a number of graph metrics that can then be combined to help analyze a students mind map and provide them with useful feedback. Even though our results show that compare 5 metrics and each metric can be used to observe student improvement, each of these metrics differs in how the metric can be interpreted and related to the process of learning.

The instructor, being acquainted with the practical aspects of the courses, can build solid connections between conceptual knowledge and real-world applications where possible. For instance, it is natural that Air Force Academy students are best motivated with flight and related activities. Hence, using flying platforms, flight dynamics and similar content in experimental studies and in-class demonstrations will play a vital role in motivating students for academic study. In this sense, a four rotor aerial experimentation platform is designed, built and utilized for courses and laboratories.

This extensive research project is multidimensional and includes several interrelated components, all of which are founded upon best practices from STEM education research. There are several individual elements within the project that operate simultaneously or sequentially and unite to form a novel teaching and learning system. The first element of the project was the transformation of the structure in our basic MSE course from primarily deductive practice to an Information Communication Technology (ICT) enabled, student centered, inductive teaching and learning environment. Collaborative learning, active/inquiry learning, concept learning, peer learning, problem/case-based learning, low stakes quizzing, mini-lectures with just-in-time reading, collaborative research writing, and constructive alignment are all important components of our multidimensional approach. Also completed as part of this research program were: detailed explorations to understand the students' pre-course knowledge and misperceptions, an investigation of student preparation and how that preparation influenced pre-course concept knowledge and overall course outcomes, and an analysis of Felder's Index of Learning Styles (ILS) assessment by student and course section. The detailed analysis of pre-course knowledge and misperceptions showed a surprising lack of pre-conceptual knowledge and revealed several important student misperceptions. This paper focuses on components of the iCollaborate project that were researched, analyzed, or developed during the Fall 2011 through Winter 2013 timeframe. First, a summary of the pre-course assessment findings is given in this paper. Second, an overview of the suite of MSE iPod applications and newly developed web applications for iCollaborate is presented.

Intelligent tutoring systems are computer programs capable of providing immediate and customized instruction or feedback to students, without the need of human intervention.

Special efforts to help students transfer smoothly into engineering and computer science have been in place since 2002 at Arizona State University (ASU) through an Academic Success and Professional Development class and a Motivated Engineering Transfer Student (METS) Center. During this time, we have become aware that transfer students come to a university with certain expectations and preconceived ideas, some which are true and some which are not. In addition, many transfer students are not aware of some of the realities they will face as a transfer. In order to check on what the actual expectations and realities are for transfer students, we surveyed 120 transfer students who were enrolled in the Academic Success Class during Fall 2012. The top six expectations were reality over which the transfer students had little control: higher tuition, some very large classes, expensive parking, a large campus, a long commute, and difficulty in parking. These expectations were followed closely by several factors to which the students had some control: GPA shock, a faster pace of classes, feeling like a freshman all over again, and not knowing where resources are. The top four expectations upon transferring were the same as the top four realities, although in a different order. For half of the students, the fifth most prevalent reality was that the METS Center helped in their transfer. The next most frequent realities were that the pace of classes was faster and that classes had more assigned homework than they had at the community college. We also examined gender differences. We detail what we are doing to help transfer students with these realities. We will use the data in this paper to inform potential and new transfer students and to help them plan for success. Even though much of this knowledge may be well known, a new transfer often does not believe that the challenges will affect him.

As engineering educators whose academic focus is information assurance and cyber security, we believe students in cyber security need the same type of access to hands on opportunities as their counter parts in hardware design or circuit design. Students should be able to configure and run their own networks, as well as explore the vulnerabilities, exploits, and remediatios needed in a cyber security professional's tool kit. Further, they need exposure to working in the complexity of the Internet. While some might argue that simulation software could be a solution, it often lacks realism. In this paper we show how our institution goes beyond the providing the standard, formalized laboratory activities for our cyber security students by developing a unique, highly configurable testbed called Internet-Scale Event and Attack Generation Environment (ISEAGE - pronounced \u201cice age\u201d) that allows us to imitate the Internet. ISEAGE provides a controlled environment that allows real attacks to be played out against the students' networks and demonstrates to them real world security concepts.

This device-similar to a webcam-allows an individual to interact with an Xbox 360 or a computer in three-dimensional space using an infrared depth-finding camera and a standard RGB camera. As of January of 2012, over 24 million units have been sold. Using a combination of custom and open-source software, we were able to develop a means for students to visualize and interact with the data allowing us to introduce the concepts and skills used in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The unique technological application, visual appeal of the output, and the widespread ubiquity of the device make this an ideal platform for raising interest in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering among high school students.In order to understand the appeal of the Kinect, a working knowledge of the technical details of the device is useful. The novelty and appeal of the Kinect sensor lies in its infrared camera, which is comprised of two distinct devices. An infrared projector sends out a 640x480 grid of infrared beams, and an infrared detector is used to measure how long the reflection of each beam takes to return to the sensor. This data set is known as a \u201cpoint cloud\u201d. This point cloud is a three-dimensional vector comprised of data points between 40 and 2000, which correspond to distance from the device of each beam. The data in this array can then be parsed to construct a 3d image. The Kinect's infrared camera operates at 30Hz, or 30 samples per second, so the device is able to deliver a frame rate that is sufficient to create the illusion of motion. This allows for the development of applications that give the user a sense of interacting in real time with the image on the screen. The unique visual appeal, novelty of interaction, and relatively easy-to-understand theory of operation make the Kinect an attractive platform for recruitment and outreach. Using the Kinect, a recruiter is able to quickly and effectively demonstrate a range of concepts involving hardware, software, and the design process on a platform that students are familiar with and find appealing. In a short window of time they are able to show examples and explain the fundamental principles of the system while providing tangible, meaningful, and enjoyable interactivity with the device itself. This level of approachability and familiarity is rare among highly-technical fields, and provides an excellent catalyst to develop interest in Electrical and Computer Engineering education.", "authors": [{"name": "Tanner Bryce Blair", "affiliation": "Sch. of Electr. & Comput.

Our observation is that students consider programming important and have reasonably good confidence (self-efficacy) that they can solve problems using MATLAB and C.

There is a significant number of students who report almost no usage at all. Results are consistent across sophomore and junior years with a slight up-tick in frequency of use for juniors.

Although there is much debate about the relative effectiveness of female-only programs, previous research comparing aspects of our female-only program to equivalent mixed-gender programs has shown that they can be particularly effective in reaching young girls, influencing their perceptions of engineers and attitudes toward engineering as a career. The addition of equivalent male-only programs has prompted additional research comparing changes in students' perceptions of engineers and attitudes toward engineering, as well as increases in learning and content knowledge. The three different gender grouped programs (female-only, male-only and mixed-gender) were identical in content. The single gender programs within the same grade were taught by the same teacher.

Achievement may also be affected by such biases. Accordingly, this research study explores the biases in K-12 science textbooks. The textbooks were analyzed using a multidimensional rubric and accompanying scoring checklist. Results of these analyses revealed dramatic biases in textbooks particularly for early elementary and high school texts. Both print and photographic biases were noted in the textbooks.

Project based learning programs offer a way to train students in these emerging fields with realistic, intensive student-designed and built projects. This paper reviews the challenges and some of the lessons learned in developing a four year high school curriculum in renewable energy and clean technology. A primary challenge in developing this kind of program is the time and complexity of gathering relevant technical material in this field and adapting it for high school students. Related to this challenge is the selection of projects that the students pursue. We've learned that these two challenges require a content area expert and substantial technical support to insure that student design projects are age and skill appropriate, safe for the class, but also keep students engaged. One key learning from this program has been the successful introduction of novel, table-top scale \u201cminisystems\u201d that emulate full scale projects such as electric vehicles. These minisystems are also low-cost enough so that a typical class can to assign one minisystem to a two person team. The renewable energy focus also enables the discussion of key environmental and economic challenges. Student designed and built thermal storage units mimic residential-scale systems. Energy arbitrage, the differential in peak and low demand prices for electricity, helps the students understand why and when these systems can be economical to operate. Other projects in biofuels also facilitate discussion about the sustainability of using food or other renewable natural resources for energy. Each course contains six to eight projects. Projects topics are developed through an interactive brainstorming session including leading teachers in the State and representatives from prominent local industry. The project topics are further refined to focus on a key problem area. This curriculum is currently in the pilot phase at numerous high schools in the Southeast.", "authors": [{"name": "John N.

A notable exception has been the use of federation protocols -commonly used for sharing laboratories from one university to other-, for actually sharing laboratories from a remote laboratory system to a C/LMS. This approach opened new doors in the simplification of the process, since it did not require the remote laboratories to make any type of change. The focus of this contribution is to provide a solution to decrease the number of functionalities required for creating an integration by providing a software component that reuses them. As shown in the contribution, this component has been implemented and two remote laboratory management systems (which provide access to multiple remote laboratories) are already supported, and a third one is under development.

The difficulty of finding suitable analogies for solving a given design problem gives rise to the current efforts on computational tools for analogy-based design. In searching for analogies, the critical functions in a design problem are potential search criteria. The study described in this paper investigates whether novice designers identify an expert-derived critical function in a design problem under three scenarios: when they are asked to report the important functions in the problem, when they are directly asked to report the critical function and when they are asked to use design-by-analogy. It is observed that student designers do not identify the expert-derived critical functions when directly asked or when asked to list important functions. However, they inherently use the expert-derived critical functions in their analogical mapping process. This suggests that, during analogical reasoning, designers tend to identify and use the same critical functions regardless of experience, and also that critical functions are valid search criteria for deriving analogies from a computational database. This insight is highly valuable for current efforts to develop computational tools for analogical reasoning.", "authors": [{"name": "Vimal Viswanathan", "affiliation": "Woodruff Sch. of Mech.

We conducted a student-centered pilot experiment to assess engineering students' perceptions of two modes of online minilectures: the first, a presentation with the instructor appearing in window, created using an off-the-shelf screen-capture software; the second, a presentation with the instructor overlaid in the slides created using recent visual communication technology that overlays the video of the instructor without any background images or outline boxes. The instructor was the same in both the presentations. Our focus here is on the following factors: 1. Comparing overall student satisfaction after watching the two modes; 2. Comparing the perceived non-verbal immediacy factors of the instructor; and, 3. Comparing the preference of video mode for future online courses. Preliminary results suggest a preference of the video mode with the instructor overlaid over that with the instructor in a box.

Although useful in collaborative environments, most applications available for the development of concept maps are designed for personal or small tablet computers, which can limit student communication in a team. In addition, the use of these applications usually requires learning or training periods, which can also interfere with the learning process. In this paper, we present a software tool for generating concept maps and constructing learning spaces under both local and distributed collaboration scenarios. Our system uses a natural interface with multi-touch and multi-user capabilities. It was specifically designed for tabletop systems, which provide a large horizontal interactive surface suitable for collaboration and face-to-face communication. The tool is also available in other platforms, which makes it useful in a variety of classroom orchestration settings.

This paper outlines the freshmen engineering design process from the introduction of the initial problem statement, mid-term review and final product delivery of a remote release system for a non-powered glider sensor system. The aviation faculty serving as the client is involved with the class from initial team selection to evaluation of the final product and student's presentation abilities. Students were asked to design a remote release system that would support the deployment of the client's glider platform from an existing kite lifting device.

In this paper, we will describe a project to develop flash drive casings. The project scenario was structured as a request by a client to design a themed set of flash drive casings and a presentation case suitable for use as a gift to outstanding employees and high value clients. Each student rapid prototyped one flash drive casing of his or her own design. The project was implemented as a series of team and individual assignments spread over the semester, with the product of those assignments returned to the instructors in memo format. This project was implemented in three phases, over several semesters, with the number of students increasing at each stage to ensure that its full scale adoption was successful. The initial test of the curricular elements was made in two, approximately 20 student summer classes. At that time, several challenges were identified. Reflection on this phase revealed a need for additional written documentation containing \u201cproject hints\u201d to help students provide designs that meet the rapid prototyper's production constraints. It was also determined that a number of intermediate assignments were needed to motivate students to remain on schedule for project completion. The project is currently nearing the end of development phase 2 and most design issues have been resolved. However, curriculum changes are warranted in response to student conceptual difficulties. As in many graphics design projects, a major challenge has been the development of three-dimensional spatial skills. Students have had difficulty creating designs containing layered structures, particularly those needed to secure the electronics within the casing. As expected in a first semester, first year course, some students have shown an inability to follow detailed instructions. While this weakness is normally only a grading issue, the flash drive covers are prototyped directly from their CAD files, making type of error particularly problematic. One major success of the project has been student excitement in the project and the improvement of their graphics skills from re-creation of existing designs to the development of novel designs.", "authors": [{"name": "Jeffrey M.

One way to tackle this problem is to increase the retention of STEM students by studying the processes that influence persistence to completion of a STEM degree. Retention is critically important to the field of engineering as over 10% of all engineering majors will switch to other STEM degrees and even more will not persist within STEM fields at all. The focus of this paper is to utilize Expectancy-Value Theory to determine how freshman engineering students (both those who persisted within the major and those who switched out of the major) perceive engineering.

While these practices are being adopted by organizations, there is significant difficulty in scaling them to the classroom.

This paper presents experiences with developing and using a peer assessment framework that provides a 360-degree view on students' project performance. Our framework has been explicitly constructed to accommodate and evaluate tacit skills that are relevant in agile software development. The framework has been evaluated with 18 bachelors- and 11 masters-level capstone projects, totaling 176 students working in self-organized teams.

The key challenges faced by the teaching of science include insufficient hands-on laboratory usage in classrooms. The main objective of the paper is to present learning approach of adaptation and usage of remote experiments of WebLab-Deusto in curriculum of secondary school. The activity was organized in collaboration with secondary school teachers of P. Andre\u0301s Urdaneta School. Educators can benefit from different teaching methods (collaborative, inquiry-, and project-based learning) integrated in WebLab-Deusto. The teaching of Ohm's Law in Physics curriculum of secondary school was one of the topics executed during this research. The remote laboratory assignment for students was developed on Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR) Open Lab Platform. The existing remote laboratories are more or less copies of hands-on ones. VISIR is a remote laboratory created by Blekinge Institute of technology (BTH) for designing, wiring and measurement of electric circuits. This main feature of VISIR allows one building a scenario of performing basic DC and low frequency AC circuits experiments related to Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. Moreover, the students will become familiar with instruments, components, manuals, data sheets, circuit wiring, and other laboratory work. In the paper the main principle of VISIR will be presented; the remote experiments executed by students will be shown. Finally, the result of integrating of remote experiments for study in Urdaneta School will be discussed.", "authors": [{"name": "Pablo Orduna", "affiliation": "DeustoTech - Deusto Inst. of Technol., Univ. of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain\u00a0"}, {"name": "Javier Garcia-Zubia", "affiliation": "Fac. of Eng., Univ. of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain"}, {"name": "Olga Dziabenko", "affiliation": "DeustoTech - Deusto Inst. of Technol., Univ. of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain\u00a0"}], "tags": ["laboratories", "open systems", "education"]}, {"title": "Infusing system design and sensors in education", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2013.6685141", "abstract": "INSIGHT, an innovate graduate STEM Fellowship Program integrates sensor technology and computer science within in a K-12 standards-based science, technology, and engineering curricula.

However, it is difficult for a teacher to teach all students to write code in accordance with a certain coding style because each of them naturally has his/her own different coding styles, and the teacher needs to advise them considering their original coding styles. To deal with this issue, the CM algorithm is introduced, which was originally developed to detect source code plagiarism in Java programming classes. It quantifies a student's coding style feature by using a set of hidden Markov models called coding models. Coding models quantify a person's code writing style as that person's coding style feature. In this paper, an attempt to apply the CM algorithm for facilitating coding style instruction is reported.

Current experience shows that the interaction of the students with these tools makes them more receptive to learning, regardless of their age. It also helps them to understand more easily abstract concepts in engineering and science subjects, associating these abstract concepts with daily life.

Students conduct the activity, fill out answers on a corresponding lab sheet, strive toward results, and then move on to a new topic. With such an abrupt change in pace and lack of assessment, a question emerges: do these activities have a lasting impact on student learning or are these labs extraneous additions to the general curriculum? In an effort to integrate engineering concepts into a middle school environment, sixth graders were tasked with a design lab popularly known as \u201cthe marshmallow challenge,\u201d which requires student teams to construct a tower from uncooked spaghetti, tape, and a single marshmallow. Approximately two months after the activity, the students who participated were asked to take a survey with four components: identification, opinion, objective, and open ended. The fifteen question survey was designed to determine if students enjoyed the activity and if students retained information from the short lecture before the activity. The results for the objective portion were averaged between classes and compared; this paper presents an analysis of those scores. Also, commonalities between written student responses are examined and discussed. These results are applicable to schools wishing to evaluate the effectiveness of brief activities similar to \u201cthe marshmallow challenge.\u201d", "authors": [{"name": "Kenneth Reid", "affiliation": "Dept. of Eng.

Thus, the study contributes to understanding middle school students' knowledge of engineering, and also to how afterschool activities shape students' conceptions of engineering. Researchers have increasingly attended to students' perceptions of themselves as engineers, and their attitudes towards engineering majors and careers. However, little research has investigated middle school students' conceptions of engineering- what engineering is and what engineers do. The purpose of this study was to understand how middle school students who join afterschool engineering clubs conceptualize engineering and how engineering afterschool club experiences influence students' conceptions of engineering. The results of our study indicate that many participants had limited conceptions of engineering and suggest a need to connect design activities with knowledge of engineering.", "authors": [{"name": "Jan Snyder", "affiliation": "Ira A.

Also, engineering design projects are contexts in which uncertainty is likely to stem from social issues as students encounter unfamiliar sociocultural practices and as individuals with diverse histories, beliefs, motivations, expectations, and values attempt to share the small space of a classroom. This qualitative discourse analytic study relies on observations and interviews to examine how social and task uncertainty management varied across three groups of students engaged in a collaborative design project. Specifically we asked, (1) how do groups vary in their management of uncertainty during engineering design projects; and (2) how does variation in uncertainty management influence groups' design practices and products?

Therefore, curricula of Biomedical Engineering (BME) courses include cardiac electrophysiology. This paper describes a virtual laboratory designed for the study of the generation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) based on cellular electrophysiology. In detail, the virtual lab includes (1) an equivalent source model for cardiac cells, (2) a formulation of the mathematical relationship between the transmembrane potential and the transmembrane current, (3) the determination of resulting extracellular potentials, and (4) the calculation of the ECG by a weighted summation of transmembrane currents. Since these tasks require specific presumption and knowledge concerning cardiac geometry, a geometrical model was constructed using anatomical stylized segments of the left ventricle. Propagation parameters control the activation sequence as well as velocity and direction for anisotropic conduction. In order to verify the developed models and algorithms simulation results were compared against experimentally obtained data under various physiological conditions. Although there is considerable scatter in the measurements, the comparison indicates that a definite relationship exists between measured and computed waveforms. Simulations interactively show physiological and pathophysiological changes in the ECGs for various user setting of the cell function. In conclusion, the interactive laboratory enables the user to study the relationship between the electric activity of cardiac cells and the resulting extracellular potentials including the ECGs on the body surface. Students increase their knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology, applied electrical circuit theory and the understanding of differential equations as well as numerical methods for solving them.", "authors": [{"name": "Edward J.
