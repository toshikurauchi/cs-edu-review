And the appliance alleviated load on the course's servers, with execution of students' programs now distributed across students' own CPUs.

This paper reports the results of a study that investigated how these final exam papers are developed, how students are prepared for these exams, and what pedagogical foundations underlie the exams. The study involved interviews of 11 programming lecturers. From our analysis of the interviews, we find that most exams are based on existing formulas that are believed to work; that the lecturers tend to trust in the validity of their exams for summative assessment; and that while there is variation in the approaches taken to writing the exams, all of the exam writers take a fairly standard approach to preparing their students to sit the exam. We found little evidence of explicit references to learning theories or models, indicating that the process is based largely on intuition and experience.", "authors": [{"name": "Margaret Hamilton", "affiliation": "RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"}, {"name": "Judy Sheard", "affiliation": "Monash University, Caulfield East, Australia"}, {"name": " Simon", "affiliation": "University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia"}, {"name": "Daryl D'Souza", "affiliation": "RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"}, {"name": "Angela Carbone", "affiliation": "Monash University, Caulfield East, Australia"}], "tags": ["programming pedagogy", "CS1", "examination papers", "assessment"]}, {"title": "Streamlining grading toward better feedback", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2462476.2462506", "abstract": "CS50 is Harvard University's introductory course aimed at majors and non-majors alike. Each week, students complete programming assignments and have traditionally received feedback from staff in the form of comments on PDFs of their code. Staff have historically reported spending significant amounts of time grading because of bottlenecks that included generating PDF documents and manually emailing feedback to students. Because we preferred that staff spend less of their time on grading logistics and more time providing feedback and helping students online or in person, we set out to improve the efficiency of the grading process.\nIn Fall 2012, we developed and deployed CS50 Submit, a web-based utility through which staff can leave feedback for students via inline \"sticky notes.\" Following the introduction of CS50 Submit, staff reported grading for 10% fewer hours (i.e., 42 minutes) per week and 13% fewer minutes (i.e., 4 minutes) per student, even while providing as much or more feedback. Meanwhile, we observed significantly higher levels of engagement with the course's online discussion board among staff, suggesting a more favorable distribution of staff workload. With CS50 Submit, we have also been able to audit exactly how much time staff spent grading each week in order to identify additional bottlenecks.\nUsing CS50 Submit, we also observed that, on average, 9% of students each week never read their graders' comments, with a peak one week of 14%. The number of students who did not read feedback increased with time, which has led us to question whether asynchronous, textual comments are the most effective feedback mechanisms for students. In future terms, we plan to experiment with in-person, interactive means of delivering feedback to students.\nIn this paper, we present CS50 Submit and the insights it has yielded into the behavior of students and staff alike.", "authors": [{"name": "Tommy MacWilliam", "affiliation": "Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA"}, {"name": "David J.

Unlike student plagiarism, this cheating behaviour is not currently detectable using automated tools.\nThis paper analyses the monetary value of contract cheating to the different parties who play a role in the contract cheating process. The main analysis is based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat. The corpus was collected between March 2005 and July 2012. The corpus was formed as part of a manual contract cheating detection process identifying students using online agencies. These online agencies are web sites which enable students to contract cheat. The agencies usually benefit from this by receiving a percentage cut of the money raised from the contract cheating that they facilitate. This corpus is used as the basis of an attempt to quantify the monetary value of contract cheating to online agencies.\nOther parties exist who benefit from the contract cheating process. The paper identifies several such parties and gives examples of the monetary value of contract cheating to each of them. Most notably this includes the contractors who bid for the opportunity to produce work on behalf of the students. Further, the paper identifies the role of intermediary contractors. These are people who post assignment requests on agency sites but who are not themselves students. These intermediary contractors appear to benefit by first receiving requests to complete work for students and then re-outsourcing this work at a much lower cost than they were paid. The group of frequent workers, that is people who regularly work on student assignments and hence benefit financially, is also identified.\nThe paper concludes by presenting the changing trends in contract cheating that the authors have observed since they started working against this form of academic misconduct in 2005.

The human body is a network of organs that must coordinate to survive. The postal service is an example of a network that connects individuals world-wide. It is only natural that networks play an important role in computing --- from networks of sensors collecting and recording data, to social networks, to the most complex network of all, the Internet. Observing the importance of networking concepts in computing, we have developed the second in a series of \"serious toys\" to use in the K-12 curriculum. In this case, the toy is an embedded hardware device designed to enhance a lecture titled \"Learning Networks, Protocols, and Algorithms\", by engaging visual and kinesthetic learners. In this paper, we describe our curriculum module and its use in an outreach program involving six middle school classes. We conclude with a summary of evaluation results that show the program produced positive results in terms of content understanding and attitudes toward Computer Science.", "authors": [{"name": "Yvon Feaster", "affiliation": "Clemson Universtiy, Clemson, SC, USA"}, {"name": "Farha Ali", "affiliation": "Lander University, Greenwood, SC, USA"}, {"name": "Jason O.

In light of these studies, a natural question is: to what extent do these results hold for subsequent, upper-division computer science courses? In this paper we describe our work in creating high-level concept questions for an upper-division computer architecture course. The questions were designed and agreed upon by subject-matter and teaching experts to measure desired minimum proficiency of students post-course. These questions were administered to four separate computer architecture courses at two different institutions: a large public university and a small liberal arts college. Our results show that students in these courses were indeed not learning as much as the instructors expected, performing poorly overall: the per-question average was only 56%, with many questions showing no statistically significant improvement from pre-course to post-course. While these results follow the trend from CS1 courses, they are still somewhat surprising given that the courses studied were taught using research-based pedagogy that is known to be effective across the CS curriculum. We discuss implications of our findings and offer possible future directions of this work.", "authors": [{"name": "Hung-Wei Tseng", "affiliation": "University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Saturnino Garcia", "affiliation": "University of San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Daniel Zingaro", "affiliation": "University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"}, {"name": "Leo Porter", "affiliation": "Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY, USA"}], "tags": ["computer architecture", "curriculum", "assessment"]}, {"title": "Using network packet generators and snort rules for teaching denial of service attacks", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2462476.2465580", "abstract": "Teaching ethical hacking techniques is fundamental to security education and allows students to better understand the ways in which computer and network systems fail.
