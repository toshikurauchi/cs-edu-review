The low levels of public R&D funds, industrial R&D, and demand for innovation alongside rising global competitive pressure on sectors with high exports in 2002 were overcome by the instigation of an STI impetus in Turkey. This presentation considers the major strategies that are determined and implemented in Turkey to make a leap forward in the field of STI. The launch of the conceptualization of Turkish Research Area (TARAL) in 2004 set into motion a mobilization with which the private and public sectors, together with NGOs, strategically focus and collaborate on R&D and innovation (RDI). As the first plan aimed to springboard the country towards the long-term expectations that are foreseen for the year 2023 based on Vision 2023, the National Science and Technology Policies Implementation Plan (BTP-UP) was established for the five year strategy timeframe of 2005-2010. BTP-UP (2005-2010) was instrumental in diversifying the policy mix that is being utilized by the TARAL actors for RDI capacity-building. Furthermore, programs for human resources for science and technology and science and society, in addition to defense and space research programs were put under the auspices of the Prime Minister.\nThe harmonization of top-down and bottom-up approaches combined with high-level leadership during the development phase of the national strategies gave rise to a swift mobilization of financial resources for TARAL and paved the way for the realization of triggering mechanisms, which include Industrial R&D and innovation grants, R&D tax incentives, and R&D and innovation-based public supply. The swift STI impetus towards becoming an ever-more dynamic system towards TARAL objectives indicate that Turkey is taking fast-paced strides to reach the major targets of raising Gross Domestic Expenditure on R&D to 2% of GDP and full-time equivalent R&D personnel to 150,000 by 2013.", "authors": [{"name": "N\u00fcket Yeti_", "affiliation": "T\u00fcbitak, Ankara, Turkey"}], "tags": ["sti for economic growth"]}, {"title": "Who's missing from the room", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1822090.1822092", "abstract": "This interactive session will provide a brief overview of the gender diversity situation including directions and potential best practices.

However, the responses to questionnaires at course evaluations show that almost all students think that the assignment really gave them better understanding of polynomial reductions in NP completeness proofs.

This paper presents our observations using Scalable Game Design over multiple years to teach middle school students, college level students, graduate students, and even middle school teachers fundamental to complex computer science and education concepts. Results indicate that Scalable Game Design appeals broadly to students, regardless of background, and is a powerful teaching tool in getting students of all ages exposed and interested in computer science. Furthermore, it is observed that many student projects exhibit transfer enabling their games to explain complex ideas, from all disciplines, to the general public.", "authors": [{"name": "Ashok R.
