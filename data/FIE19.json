These professionals possess skills to analyze and derive intelligence from big data generated by enterprises. Currently, universities and colleges have not been able to produce sufficient professionals to meet the ever-growing demand for data analytics skill sets. A possible reason for this may be the narrow focus and lack of interdisciplinary approach to big data analytics education. To address this challenge, this panel brings together practitioners, researchers and educators in big data and analytics; to explore the potentials for developing an interdisciplinary curriculum that will deliver data analytics skills to students across all other academic majors. This might help to produce more agile data analytics professionals and close the gap between demand and supply of those professionals.", "authors": [{"name": "Emeka C.

Teaching machine learning involves introducing students to complex concepts in statistics, linear algebra, and optimization. In order for students to better grasp concepts in machine learning, we provide them with hands-on exercises. These types of immersive experiences will expose students to the different stages of the practical uses of machine learning. The data collection apparatus is based on applications (apps) developed for the Android platform. Due to the accessible nature of the app and the exercises based on the app, this approach is useful for students across all majors.We provide the students with three different sets of activities, the first of which will introduce the basics of machine learning with specially designed artificial datasets. The second and third activities involve data collection, modeling, training, and testing, as applied to machine learning algorithms. The second activity will involve collecting touch/swipe data on mobile devices from students as they use a touch logger app. The third activity uses the Reflections app to collect cross-correlation data from rooms with different purposes. These hands-on activities guide the students through every step of the machine learning process. Student learning is assessed for each activity by holding workshops for undergraduate students. A workshop with the first activity outlining the basics of machine learning was given in the fall of 2018 and significant student learning was demonstrated. Workshops for the second and third activities are planned for the fall semester of 2019.

Pre-secondary educators are those at the K-12 level, while post-secondary educators teach at the college and university level. Educators are often taken for granted, with few considering the differences between the motivations and teaching styles of those who work in pre- versus post-secondary education. These researchers recognized this gap in the literature and developed a survey that they distributed to a nationwide audience. The survey was created to obtain the opinions of a broad spectrum of educational professionals at different levels and in different STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. This distribution was done through a variety of professional teaching organizations and educator networks, with the intent of reaching educators teaching STEM at all levels. In addition to collecting demographics on the study participants, the survey had three constructs. These constructs focused on teaching practices, beliefs about teaching STEM subjects, and the educator's perceived ability to teach across disciplines. The researchers have separated the data provided by the participants into two groups: K-12 educators and post-secondary educators. The focus is on the comparison of some of the basic demographic style questions as reported by the survey participants. The survey reached predominantly male educators teaching technology or engineering at the undergraduate level. Approximately 87 percent of respondents were post-secondary educators, with the remaining 23 percent representing pre-secondary educators. The surveyed population represented all disciplines of STEM. The survey showed that most STEM educators at the pre-secondary level had little to no experience outside of academia, while most educators at the post-secondary level had at least one year of experience. The pre-secondary educators responding have been teaching for fewer years on average than those at the post-secondary level. The researchers suggest that this understanding and future research will support the need for industry connections at the K-12 level and more insight into how students can best be served as they transition from high school to college, based on differences in course stile and educator experience. Evaluating these differences may allow educators to adapt their teaching style at the pre- and post-secondary level to help students entering college transition from learning in classrooms of around 20 students to lecture halls.", "authors": [{"name": "Anne Lucietto", "affiliation": "Purdue University,Deparment of Engineering Technology,West Lafayette,Indiana,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Emily Schott", "affiliation": "Purdue University,Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics,West Lafayette,Indiana,USA"}, {"name": "Liza Russell", "affiliation": "Purdue University,Department of Mechanical Engineering,West Lafayette,Indiana,USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["training", "government", "engineering profession", "licenses", "stem", "industries"]}, {"title": "A pilot study of a directed self-placement exam and a workshop designed to improve student learning outcomes in a junior level circuits and signals course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028373", "abstract": "In this work, which is intended to be a Work in Progress Paper in the Research Category, a pilot study of a directed self-placement exam and a workshop designed to lower the DFW rate (% of students who earn a D, F, or W) is presented.

During a series of Java classes conducted by our team, we verified that these difficulties were also related to the use of software that is not tailored for their impairment. We also saw that DHI students encountered many problems while developing and evolving their codes using the traditional tools, for instance, visual signs to perform tasks, can be difficult to understand, in addition, the high degree of abstraction required for the programming logic, can be an accessibility barrier for them. Thus, we decided to propose JAD aiming to provide accessible debugging for DHI. The JAD uses the concept of metaphorical interfaces, adopting appropriate symbols and signs borrowed from traffic to aid in the process of code debugging and evolution.

The U.S. Congress and other governmental and industrial organizations have recognized that teaching Quantum Computing in university-level Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs is strategically important for workforce development along with technology development. Success in this endeavor requires generating genuine interest in the topic and motivating potential students. Quantum Computing requires an understanding of relatively difficult related subjects including physics, math and computer science. Many computer science and electrical engineering students shy away from quantum computing because of its complexity. This paper discusses our success with generating interest in quantum computing among graduate students and motivating them through exploring, in related courses, some aspects of quantum computing that have the potential to generate discontinuities. The approach is also examined in terms of the Scientific Learning Cycle as discussed by Wankat & Oreovicz. Opportunities and challenges of adding Quantum Computing to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering programs were studied through a student small group project in a cybersecurity course. The work built on extensive research into the effectiveness of small group projects and the role of \u201cplay\u201d in learning. Our small group project on quantum computing was introduced three years ago into a cybersecurity course which is required for all students in our university's Masters in Computer Science and Masters in Electrical Engineering programs. The basic goals of the project are to teach students some basics of quantum computing by allowing them to \u201cplay with it\u201d and to alert students to the fact that quantum computing is a rapidly developing new field that they need to follow during at least the next decade. The small group project helped students to explore the potential of quantum computing to substantially undermine current Public Key Cryptography and, at the same time provide a new approach to encryption that is even more secure than Public Key Cryptography. A qualitative analysis of discussions and assigned tasks suggests that this strategy succeeded in generating significant interest in quantum computing among students.

The traditional approach to teaching different algorithms is to introduce each algorithm as a stand-alone approach. For example, when one goes over different sorting algorithms, one may start with logically simpler sorts like bubble sort or selection sort, and progress to the more challenging algorithms like heap sort or merge sort. We argue that there is another way to introduce a family of algorithms - identify the design patterns common to a group of algorithms, introduce the patterns first, before differentiating one approach from another. In this way, we focus on overall constructs and operations required, rather than how to complete each one of the sorts separately.This approach allows for an abstract class, such as Sort, to be first identified from a top-down approach, followed by the introduction and identification of which design patterns an actual algorithm falls - say divide-and-conquer for merge sort. The advantage of the approach is to allow the student to explore new realizations of solutions to problems developed from the abstract class, rather than studying a specific implementation of an algorithm.", "authors": [{"name": "Carolyn Pe Rosiene", "affiliation": "University of Hartford,Department of Computing Sciences,W.

The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics.

Further, work on undergraduate research experiences has typically focused on science research, and relatively little work has been done to understand student development during research experiences in engineering and computational fields.

For this work, we utilized narrative-style interviews to collect students' stories about their experiences and struggles in school.

Three major findings of this study are; 1.) messages about smartness in educational systems have implications for students' identity as smart and beliefs about smartness, 2.) social experiences have a significant impact, particularly for the female students, on identity and beliefs about smartness, and 3.) students recognize the limits of-and developed a resistance to-normative indicators of ability (i.e., GPA). Our research contributes a more holistic understanding of the formation of beliefs about smartness and identity in the educational trajectories of undergraduate engineering students along with insight into the complex interaction between beliefs about smartness and identity.

As the benefits of physical modeling and communities of practice have been increasingly documented, makerspaces have sprung up across numerous college and university campuses. Although makerspaces vary between institutions, they generally have resources that provide users the opportunity to perform hands-on design and obtain build experience. These facilities also bring people of different disciplines together, encouraging the sharing of perspectives and fostering collaboration among users. Literature pertaining to makerspaces shows that enhanced learning occurs within students who utilize these spaces. The new approach was pilot tested in the fall 2018 semester. In this math and physics-intensive sophomore-level course, the instructional goals in utilizing the makerspace included an enhanced understanding of the physical significance and application of core course concepts. The main course concept demonstrated was planar truss design, as pursued through the physical construction and testing of balsa wood bridges. Students were asked to design, build, and test a bridge prototype in a hands-on fashion using the makerspace. A second section of the course taught by the same instructor did not utilize the makerspace to build and test a prototype; instead, the students designed and analyzed a bridge prototype using 3D modeling and finite element analysis software, enabling a comparison. An assessment plan was developed that included the gathering of both student-perspectives, as well as direct performance data, including students' performance on the bridge prototyping project. Via survey, students were asked, prior to and after completing the bridge project, their perspectives about the makerspace, and if the makerspace enhanced their understanding of statics as well as their creativity and other professional skills, respectively. In this WIP paper, we will describe the bridge prototyping project and students' use of the makerspace from the instructional team's viewpoint. We will also present preliminary assessment data demonstrating student perspectives on the approach. Lessons learned will also be discussed, including the instructor's plans for continuing this approach in future semesters.", "authors": [{"name": "Karthika Ramanathan", "affiliation": "University of Pittsburgh,Dept. of Industrial Engineering,Pittsburgh, PA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Matthew M.

Analysis of the outcomes of students from the Senior Exit Survey gauges the competence of graduates in their field of study. This survey is routinely conducted on students close to finishing an undergraduate degree and contains information about the various experiences while learning at Cal Poly Pomona. Understanding of these outcomes allows the faculty and the administration to improve the courses in an effective manner. The basis of this study is to cluster student learning outcomes and distinguish those with superior similarity. These outcomes can be fused for a targeted approach towards designing optimized courses. The clusters were developed using one of the most frequently used unsupervised learning techniques, or, the hierarchical clustering algorithm through R statistical analysis software. This algorithm had been proven to be reliable yet easy to interpret in past literature. For the purposes of this study, the hierarchical clustering model is defined by the dissimilarity measure between each pair of observation using the Euclidean distance along with the use of both complete and average linkages. The results from the two linkages were displayed using dendrograms. For additional visualization and verification of the clusters, a heat map was also constructed to illustrate the results using the complete linkage. A comparison of the results from these two linkages demonstrates exceptional similarities amongst the clusters; all but one outcome did not fall within the same clusters.

Since this form of learning is relatively new and constantly evolving, there is room for improvement in many areas of this digital learning system, especially in accessibility. There has been little improvement in these systems on assisting or helping students with any sort of disabilities, and content added within the learning management systems as frameworks is also lacking in incorporating features required for accessibility. Based on student responses to an initial survey, there could be \u201cbetter features to better enable interaction and communication.\u201d This paper addresses the research questions:\u00b7 Does the type of webpage influence the number of accessibility errors on a webpage? and \u00b7 Does the individual instructor who created the content for the webpage influence the number of accessibility errors?These research questions were grounded within research that has been completed within the computer science, learning management systems, and accessibility fields. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a worldwide standard, was used to access the accessibility of multiple sections of introductory engineering course websites. Further research into the accessibility of common learning management systems supported the idea that certain prevalent accessibility faults were innate to the learning management system itself and were unable to be modified by the instructor of the course. This affected the analysis and the results of the sequential studies performed. The particular learning management system (LMS) utilized in this study was Canvas. Canvas was chosen due to its control of the market share and its use within the authors' institution.To properly understand and answer the research questions, a series of three experiments was conducted. The first observational experiment was an exploratory complete randomized design investigating the number of WCAG level AAA errors found per page by type of page and by instructor. A generalized linear model was selected using Minitab. The second and third observational experiments were nested designs exploring errors per page dependent on instructor and type of page; ANOVA (analysis of variance) tests were run along the Tukey post hoc test and a check of the assumptions.All p values for each comparison were found to be significant. The post hoc tests denoted that there are significant differences between particular types of web pages and the instructors who produce the content for those pages.The result of these analyses were used to develop a workshop and guide to ensure professors and instructors are given accessibility information that is pertinent when creating an engineering course website. Additionally, engineering professors and instructors were given a quick tips and tricks sheet and were shown how to implement these suggestions into their engineering course website in order to maximize the impact of the work.

The entrepreneurial mindset has been defined as a specific state of mind which orientates human conduct towards entrepreneurial activities and outcomes. The development of entrepreneurial mindset is particularly important in bridging education to the future in which individuals must be sensitive to and be able to identify and respond appropriately to the constant changes and associated opportunities that characterize the future. While different approaches are being employed to inculcate and develop this mindset in engineering students, the heavy technical course load as well as the technically-oriented mindset that many engineering students have, pose great challenges to entrepreneurial mindset development.In order to overcome these challenges, an innovative approach in which teams of interdisciplinary engineering students participate in two semesters design courses that combine engineering design with the entrepreneurial mindset has been implemented. In the first semester, the focus was on the customer discovery process to identify and evaluate opportunities, and engineering design. In the second semester, the course combines engineering design with an entrepreneurial story component. In 14 out of the 16 weeks course period in the second semester, students were required to read a short chapter every week outside class from the book: Rich Dad's Guide to Investing by Robert Kiyosaki. Unlike most books used in schools, the book uses a real-life story to teach important entrepreneurial concepts. The chapters are easy to read and are based on the true story of how Rich Dad taught Robert Kiyosaki how to develop the entrepreneurial mindset and capacity. The students were required to answer a short quiz every week after reading each chapter. They were also required to reflect on and document in their journals the lessons learned and how to apply it to themselves. The goal is that the students can better relate to the character and the context of the story thereby facilitating the learning of important entrepreneurial concepts. The development of the entrepreneurial mindset of the students will be assessed through reflection analysis. The study will provide insights into the change in the students' entrepreneurial mindset as a result of combining design with story-based learning in the second semester as against the first semester where design and customer discovery process was employed. The findings from this preliminary study may provide an efficient and effective strategy for developing the entrepreneurial mindset in engineering students.", "authors": [{"name": "Paul Talaga", "affiliation": "University of Indianapolis,R.

Well-formed planning, communication and intra-team skills are often differentiating elements among the most successful project teams. The abstract nature of these professional competencies requires a contextual basis to effectively develop within a higher cognitive domain. To this end, our capstone course has adopted a platform that offers students the freedom to choose a project sponsor that aligns with their own professional skills or desired learning environment. In a typical cohort we offer a mixture of industry sponsors (small to medium size local companies, emerging startups and established industry leaders) and faculty sponsors developing projects tied to their on-going research. Students have attributed this latitude in sponsor environment, character and style to their success in the course and transition to a professional career. This work offers an extension of this approach to include projects sponsored and managed by post capstone students. Students interested in an entrepreneurial-based experience tend to select this project and cite the nature of the mentorship as a driver for their decision.

A multitude of model curricula and recommendations have been presented and discussed in international fora in recent years, with varying levels of impact on education, policy and practice. This paper address three key questions: i) what is taught and what should be taught for cybersecurity to general computer science students; ii) should cybersecurity be taught stand-alone or in an integrated manner to general computer science students; and iii) can accreditation by national professional, statutory and regulatory bodies enhance the provision of cybersecurity within a body's jurisdiction? Evaluating how cybersecurity is taught in all aspects of computer science is clearly a task of considerable size, one that is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead a case study-based research approach - primarily focusing on the UK - has been adopted to evaluate the evidence of the teaching of cybersecurity within general computer science to university-level students. Thus, in the context of widespread international computer science/engineering curriculum reform, what does this need to embed cybersecurity knowledge and skills mean more generally for institutions and educators, and how can we teach this subject more effectively?

Classifying the specific uses of the iPad in FYE is unique in understanding student perceptions of mobile learning. Frequency and type of use, along with perception of perceived value were measured using a survey asking students who had completed one semester of engineering education to rate how, where, and how frequently they used the iPad in FYE. Perceptions of value to the learning process were measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale. There were 251 usable responses for this preliminary analysis, collected from students using an iPad in both dedicated iPad sections and non-dedicated iPad sections of FYE. Students reported a high level of use of the iPad for FYE outside of the classroom, a moderate to high level in the classroom, and a low level of use for FYE laboratory activities. Students frequently use the iPad for learning and collaboration activities. The iPad is used less frequently for reflection activities. Most students use the iPad to access the course management system and for note taking with the Notability application. Many students also use it for drawing and for watching instructional videos. Perceptions of value are low to moderate, with value for group activities and for improving the FYE experience having the highest mean values.

The Indiana Celebration of Women in Computing (InWIC) followed in 2014 and provided a similar format to that adopted by GHC. Based on the data from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 InWIC assessments, a regional conference that supports women in computing makes a positive difference in the lives of women in computing. Data published by the Anita Borg Institute (ABI) for the same 2014-2016 era also provide three encouraging assessments of GHC. This paper compares the two sets of 20142016 assessments of both INWIC and GHC, using conference goals as comparison criteria.", "authors": [{"name": "Alka Harriger", "affiliation": "Purdue University,Computer and Information Technology Department,West Lafayette,USA,47907"}, {"name": "Gloria Childress Townsend", "affiliation": "DePauw University,Department of Computer Science,Greencastle,USA,46135\u00a0"}], "tags": ["computational modeling", "lightning", "computer science", "engineering profession", "companies", "industries"]}, {"title": "Engineering students and professionals living with a mental illness: an exploration of their experiences and challenges", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028416", "abstract": "Mental health has only recently come to the forefront of conversations in the media and academia. Mental health conditions are often triggered by environmental factors like academic stress, interpersonal conflicts, financial pressure, and career concerns. Students living with mental illness may drop out of college due to experiencing a mental health crisis at school. At the same time, engineering is a demanding profession that requires rigorous training. Therefore, the educational and professional experiences of engineers can be overexerting. This challenge can be even higher for engineering students and professionals who struggle with a diagnosed mental illness. Furthermore, the heightened stigma that surrounds mental illness might deter this group from seeking help and persisting in engineering. However, little is known about the experiences of people with a diagnosed mental illness while navigating the training and culture of engineering. Acknowledging and understanding the challenges faced by engineering students and professionals living with a mental illness is the first step towards implementing change in engineering education that would provide adequate support for these students to reach their goals. This work-in-progress reports on the first stage of a larger exploratory study aiming to describe the experiences of engineering students and professionals living with a mental illness and to understand how the engineering culture has impacted their experiences. Results will inform future research on student persistence and will inform engineering programs that want to support students who live with mental illness. Ultimately, this work will help eliminate stigma in engineering education and support the success of those living with mental health conditions.", "authors": [{"name": "Nikitha Sambamurthy", "affiliation": "Zybooks,USA"}, {"name": "Xinrui Rose Xu", "affiliation": "Purdue University,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Matilde Sanchez-Pena", "affiliation": "701 Stadium Ave. & Purdue University,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Nichole Ramirez", "affiliation": "Purdue University,USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["training", "lifting equipment", "engineering profession", "mental disorders", "companies", "interviews", "engineering students"]}, {"title": "Adaptive Educational Resource Model to Promote Robotic Teaching in STEM Courses", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028417", "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Category Full Paper presents the proposal of a model to develop adaptive educational resources, with the aim to promote robotic teaching in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) courses.

In this context, we surveyed students with the ARCS IMMS and UWES-S questionnaires to respectively measure their levels of motivation and engagement in a CS1 course. Results show that, on the categories of motivation, the PBL approach relates to students' attention and relevance. It also relates to confidence and satisfaction, either positively or negatively, depending on course planning. The approach, on the other hand, does not have much relation with the categories of engagement.

In social domains, implicit theories are associated with development of social and soft skills, and groupwork behaviour. This article reviews the most significant research on implicit theories in educational and social domains, and shows significant research gaps in computing education.

In total, Florida is home to over 20,000 AM companies employing over 320,000 workers. Florida is also geographically diverse, being simultaneously one of the most urban and one of the most rural highly populous states in the country. To characterize Florida's AM employment needs, we sought to determine how AM jobs were distributed across the state. We analyzed 108 job postings from Florida employers who were seeking manufacturing and engineering technicians through publicly available job postings. We used text mining to extract the knowledge areas and verbs in the documents that AM employers identified in job postings and desired from their entry-level employees. We compared those topics and verbs to the ones found in the Florida Department of Education's (FLDoE) AM curriculum framework for two-year programs. We found varying levels of alignment, and, in some instances, misalignment, between employers' desired topics and competency levels and those found in FLDoE Frameworks. Our findings not only highlight the importance of industry-education partnerships to tailor preparation to employer needs, but also suggest that a deeper exploration and analysis of AM jobs is needed to further determine alignment to FLDoE frameworks.

Students dropout in university courses have long been a major issue leading to social, academic and financial impacts. Predictive modelling analysis has been used as a tool to identify at an early stage probable cases of dropout. In distance learning, this type of analysis is made possible mostly because of the increasing adoption rate of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) where data on the student academic activities can be continuously recorded. This paper discusses the design and validation of a Learning Analytics system for early identification of students at risk of dropping out. The case study presented relies on data collected from two postgraduate courses as part of Brazils Open University. The methodology for the system design and validation comprises the steps to build an intelligent data pipeline. Jupyter Notebooks have been d used as the data science analysis environment in order to create data pipelines and have their performance evaluated.

In particular, use of STEM-related curricula, such as the curriculum found in STEM schools and PLTW schools, has been recommended as a strategy for increasing students' college readiness and reducing barriers to college entrance and success. The purpose of this study was to analyze students' postsecondary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) preparedness for entering academic and career pathways. The authors examined college and career readiness of students in grades 11-12 who attended: (a) schools implementing Project Lead the Way curriculum (PLTW schools), (b) Texas inclusive STEM high schools that do not implement PLTW curriculum (T-STEM schools), and (c) schools that do not implement any STEM curriculum or PLTW curriculum (non-STEM/non-PLTW schools). The results of this study indicated that T-STEM schools had the highest rate of student career readiness when compared to PLTW and non-PLTW/non-STEM schools. However, non-PLTW/non-STEM schools had the highest rate of student college readiness when compared to the other two school types. In addition, there was a statistically significant correlation between college readiness and career readiness. These findings lay the groundwork for educators to continue modifying educational curricula to support students' academic readiness for their future careers.", "authors": [{"name": "Robert M.

The capstone experience in mechanical engineering at the University of Maine consists of a senior year, 2 semester 7ch sequence, where student teams design, build and test a mechanical device. It not only constitutes the culmination of the plan of study, but also represents a signature component of the curriculum and student experience in the department due to its intensive nature that includes the construction and testing of the project. In the past, and due to stagnant teaching capacity coupled with high student growth in the major, the aim had been to streamline the implementation by increasingly standardizing the experience and assessment around a common land-drone theme. However, a recent change and expansion of the instructor team to two faculty members, combined with the necessity to improve the assessment of the ABET outcomes linked to the course, motivated the transformation of the sequence presented here. This transformation has included the development of a robust and transparent assessment system that incorporates both formative and summative feedback modes including continuous peer evaluation, as well as an active outward-opening of the projects to research entities on and off-campus as well as industry. Initial results indicate an almost three-fold increase in externally sponsored projects, as well as the successful assessment of the learning outcomes as evidenced by ABET and anonymous student surveys that support the perception of the system being capable of fair and transparent allocation of individual grades in a team environment.", "authors": [{"name": "Wilhelm A Friess", "affiliation": "University of Maine,Mechanical Engineering Department,Orono,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Andrew J Goupee", "affiliation": "University of Maine,Mechanical Engineering Department,Orono,USA"}], "tags": ["springs", "testing", "stakeholders", "teamwork", "task analysis", "mechanical engineering", "industries"]}, {"title": "Encouraging Diversity in Computer Science among Young People: Using a Games Design Intervention based on an Integrated Pedagogical Framework", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028436", "abstract": "This research to practice full paper presents the results from using a games design intervention to encourage diversity in the uptake of computer science by young people, explore stereotypes with them and increase their awareness of careers in the sector. The intervention is based on an integrated pedagogical framework appropriate for use with primary age school children (age 7 - 11 years). Despite the increasing use of technology, the percentage of young people taking up a computer science education-career path remains stubbornly low in the UK and across a number of other countries, particularly for females and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Previous research suggests that games can be used to generate interest and engage young people with computer science. Other studies advocate targeting young people at an earlier age (7 years or below) and sustaining engagement throughout their education to widen participation in a particular sector. In this intervention, young people designed and developed individual games through a three stage process: design and story development; game building; testing and evaluation. This research adopts elements from two pedagogical learning theories Direct Instruction and Cognitive Constructivism to create an integrated pedagogical framework to support the game creation process and enable effective learning. This provides an approach that can cater for a range of participants' abilities along the novice-expert spectrum and provide an engaging and age appropriate educational experience.The intervention was completed in two cycles: cycle 1 consisted of a series of workshop sessions with 20 young people aged 9-10 years over a period of 5 weeks; and cycle 2 was a single session with 19 young people aged 7-11 years. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted for evaluating the intervention using the following instruments; pre and post questionnaires, planning sheets, the games created by the participants and a set of already developed engagement factors. Results show an increase from 5% to 25% in participants' aspiration towards a computer science career. 45% of the young people also knew more careers in the game industry post-intervention. Girls chose a variety of diversity in their lead characters while boys chose mainly male human lead characters in the games that they designed. Participants' evaluation of each other's games using the engagement factors showed girls were more interested in receiving feedback than boys. This paper highlights the effectiveness of combining different learning approaches to provide an age appropriate intervention. It also presents evidence on the positive effect of using games in the classroom to explore stereotypes, and learn about, and encourage career choices in computer science.", "authors": [{"name": "Joe Shimwell", "affiliation": "Northumbria University,Faculty of Engineering and Environment,Newcastle Upon Tyne,United Kingdom"}, {"name": "Itoro Emembolu", "affiliation": "Northumbria University,Faculty of Engineering and Environment,Newcastle Upon Tyne,United Kingdom\u00a0"}, {"name": "Rebecca Strachan", "affiliation": "Northumbria University,Faculty of Engineering and Environment,Newcastle Upon Tyne,United Kingdom\u00a0"}, {"name": "Opeyemi Dele-Ajayi", "affiliation": "Northumbria University,Faculty of Engineering and Environment,Newcastle Upon Tyne,United Kingdom\u00a0"}, {"name": "Carol Davenport", "affiliation": "Northumbria University,Faculty of Engineering and Environment,Newcastle Upon Tyne,United Kingdom\u00a0"}], "tags": ["education", "aging", "buildings", "computer science", "engineering profession", "task analysis", "games"]}, {"title": "Assessment of Self-Regulated Learning in Service-Learning Project in a First-Year Seminar in Engineering Course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028437", "abstract": "This Full Paper in the Research category examines the use of self-regulated learning in a service-learning project carried out as part of our First-Year Seminar in Engineering coursework.

The FLC constitutes a completely different kind of experience in which faculty can fulfill their service commitment to the department. Unlike other committees which are almost exclusively focused on completion of tasks assigned by leaders in the department's administration, the FLC engages faculty in reading, discussion, and project planning around a shared topic of interest. FLCs are designed to engage faculty, create buy-in for change within the department through participation, create a community of fellow engineers that can rely on one another for discussion and ideas, and give the facilitators a platform to address difficult but necessary topics to support wide-spread departmental change.

The need for online mentoring at many higher education institutions is becoming greater every day due to challenges students go through related to traveling to school or schedules that conflict with the traditional face-to-face mentoring and office hours. Online peer mentoring with trained mentors could be a convenient option to help students at different campuses or at different universities and/or community colleges. In this paper, procedures and steps required for peer mentors for face-to-face and online mentoring scenarios are presented based on an initial pilot study. Online peer mentoring was implemented in a low-level engineering course (e.g. engineering mechanics). In addition, in this study online mentoring is explored through a study to determine best practices, local student perceptions and preferences, and to identify required additional implementation steps. For example, student opinions were collected to recognize student preferences among face-to-face or online mentoring at our multi-campus minority serving institution. With the new generation of minority engineering students taking classes in different campuses, it was expected that there would be an increasing preference for online mentoring. However, current student opinions have indicated that they prefer face-to-face mentoring, but also suggesting that in some circumstances, online mentoring is convenient and cost effective. Either way, mentees expect the mentors to be supportive, well-knowledgeable, skilled, and preferably with previous mentoring experience in person, online, or both. Furthermore, to prepare good mentoring sessions, student mentors must work with the professors to ensure students have assignments to complete, and that mentoring is available at convenient hours.

For example, the single link clustering algorithm groups individuals together that have the smallest Euclidean distance from each other. In Q-Methodology, individuals are grouped by evaluating person-to-person correlations. For example, if two individuals have a correlation of 0.78, they are likely to be grouped together whereas individuals with a correlation of 0.09 are likely to be in different groups. In this paper, we outline multiple clustering approaches, the grouping mechanism in Q-Methodology, and discuss the differences between these two approaches when grouping participants. During this discussion, we will use an example from our own engineering education research to compare grouping results from the same data set.

This fact is corroborated by the literature that report alarming failure and dropout rates in CS0 (Introduction to Computer Science) courses. On the other hand, forecasts about the demand for software developers indicate exponential growth over the next decade.In this context, reducing the cognitive workload for learners is desirable. For instance, the integration of a web-based environment with some visual programming tool and automatic assessment could benefit learners.The adoption of a unique environment where the students could learn how to solve problems using algorithms and receive immediate feedback may reduce the slope of the learning curve. Moreover, the possibility of using the same tool to communicate with their teachers and colleagues can positively affect their learning.Also, the visual programming paradigm can reduce the need for memorization of a programming language syntax. It allows learners to focus their attention on solving the problem algorithmically.There are several tools that provide automated assessment evaluation. Some of these can be used with Web browsers, but very few of them can be integrated with a Learning Management System (LMS).

There is also ample evidence of the opposite experience, where students, even if initially highly motivated, end up unable to engage in a meaningful manner. In this paper, we analyse three courses in order to better understand why the level of student engagement varies to such a high degree, with the aim of opening for seeing underlying factors explaining this. Further, we illustrate and discuss our framework with empirical data collected from at Uppsala University. We study the courses using different research approaches (or perspectives), based in the sociocultural tradition, namely Activity Theory (as described by Engestro\u0308m), Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky), and Communities of Practice (Lave & Wenger). These approaches serve as lenses with the aim of finding common factors in the learning environments that are collectively created by the students and their teachers during the extent of the courses. Our results point towards the need to establish a joint understanding between students and teachers at several different levels: at a course level in terms of the aim of a course and its possible outcomes, but also personal aims related to what the course could lead to for everyone involved.

The intervention instrument consists of a corpus of human errors and a tool to support human error based software requirements inspections. The primary aim of developing this instrumentation and training material is to impart SE/CS students with the knowledge about the most frequently committed human errors during the software development process. Goal and Method: First, a study was conducted with Industry Practitioners with the goal of examining if the practitioners believed that human errors and human error training are useful and relevant to the software development process. Next, based on feedback from the practitioners, a study was conducted in an undergraduate Software Engineering course where students were trained using the human error instrument and were asked to perform error based requirements inspections. The high-level goal of this paper is to evaluate whether requirements inspections supported by human errors can be used to deliver knowledge about software engineering human errors as well as knowledge about requirements inspections (a key industry skill) to students.

Females are underrepresented in STEM fields despite the need for additional STEM professionals and programs designed to enfranchise women. Within this study, researchers examined how an individual's confidence in his or her ability to implement the engineering design process and to create innovative products differed by gender. Given the underrepresentation of females in STEM fields, researchers in the present study believe that participating in a residential camp in which students attend daily STEM project-based classes that incorporate the engineering design process (EDP), panels sessions, and STEM lab tours with STEM professionals will improve their confidence. Seventy-two students responded to both the pre-and post- Students Attitudes toward STEM(S-STEM) surveys which were used to determine if students who attended a STEM camp in which they were introduced to and applied the engineering design process (EDP) experienced improved confidence in using the EDP. Cohen's d effect sizes, confidence intervals, and paired t-tests were calculated by gender to analyze the data in this quasiexperimental study. Effect size results indicated males were more confident in their ability to design and build innovative products than females by more than one standard deviation. In addition, results from the paired t-tests by gender indicated that male students were statistically significantly more confident in designing and building innovative products by the end of camp. Conversely, female students became less confident in their ability to ideate, design, and build innovative products after attending the STEM summer camp. The combination of female students' prior low self-confidence, working in co-educational groups, and the significant increase of male students' confidence during the camp could have contributed to the perpetuation of female students' low self-confidence in applying the engineering design process at the end of camp.

It is well known, that students see multiple-choice and true/false problems as not completely fair because they do not take into account partially correct answers. Non-major courses such that Math and Statistics for Engineering and Computer Science majors create additional challenges because they require simultaneous content knowledge in more than one subject. A reliable automated method to assign partial credit for multiple-choice and true/false problems can greatly improve both quality and perception of fairness of the assessment. There are two major approaches to address the issue with multiple-choice problems, see e.g. [1], [2].

We had an expert teacher label 243 Calculus problems with the skills required to solve each problem and then use PFA to predict student performance using a dataset with 1609 students. In this paper, we improved our labeling of the skills by adding new difficulty tags as well as showing how to apply interactive machine learning to help the expert teacher improve their labeling of the skills required for each problem. This can then improve the prediction accuracy for future classes doing the same problems. It can also help the expert teacher improve the definition of the skills to make them more effective features for predicting student performance. The technique we present is to use a human-in-the-loop hill climbing process where a skill is added or removed, and we test to see whether this significantly improves the predictions for that problem over all students. If so, then the instructor is asked to verify whether indeed that particular skill should be removed or added. The new skill could be the result of the expert making a mistake in labelling a problem with skills, but it could also suggest that a modification of the skill definition would yield more accurate predictions.

In order to close the gap between these introductory Robotics courses for beginners at K-12 level and common Robotics university courses, the MINT-Robo project was developed. Based on previously implemented K-12 Robotics projects, it is designed around the central topic of autonomous mobile robots. Complex contents, usually taught at university level, are prepared for the project's target group. Following the principles of constructionism, the project comprises a variety of hands-on elements, applying a project-based learning approach.

A syllabus gives fundamental information about a course in a university. For students, a syllabus is one of the most important documents to take a course, because the students can grasp the topics covered by the course through the syllabus. For faculties, a set of syllabi is useful to understand the curriculum offered by the university. Thus, a syllabus is one of the most important clues in the analysis of the educational activities. Some previous works reported that the massive course syllabi of computer science (CS) curricula from about 50 universities can disclose the interesting structures in the CS curricula. In addition, they were useful to develop a tool for supporting students and faculties. However, the course syllabi were collected manually. Therefore, it was difficult to increase the number of syllabi largely. It was also difficult to keep the collected syllabi up-to-date. The semi-automatic crawling of massive course syllabi is needed for further analysis. In this paper, we investigate the pages of the course syllabi at the websites of the top 100 universities in Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018 (THE2018) with computer science as subject. The pages were collected by a simple crawling and selected manually. From this, we could find the syllabus pages at the websites of about 60 universities. Then, we discovered that the structures of the syllabus pages can be categorized into three types: Link Type, Whole Type, and Database Type. A Link Type consists of a directory page with the hyperlinks to many syllabus pages, where each page corresponds to one syllabus. A Whole Type consists of a whole page which includes many syllabi in it. A Database Type consists of an entrance page to the database from which all the syllabi can be searched. The numbers of Link Type, Whole Type, and Database Type were 31, 17, and 12, respectively. Furthermore, we found that only a few key pages (namely, the directory pages, the whole pages, and the entrance pages) can be discovered automatically to a certain degree by the linear support vector machine. Especially, the directory pages and the whole pages could be found quite accurately. These results are expected to be useful to enable the semi-automatic crawling of the syllabi from websites.", "authors": [{"name": "Kazunori Yamaguchi", "affiliation": "The University of Tokyo,Graduate School of Arts and Sciences,3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro,Tokyo,Japan"}, {"name": "Takayuki Sekiya", "affiliation": "The University of Tokyo),Information Technology Center,3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro,Tokyo,Japan\u00a0"}, {"name": "Yoshitatsu Matsuda", "affiliation": "Seikei University,Department of Computer and Information Science,3-3-1 Kichijojikitamachi, Musashino-shi,Tokyo,Japan\u00a0"}], "tags": ["education", "libraries", "computer science", "databases", "hypertext systems", "support vector machines", "web pages"]}, {"title": "Introducing Machine Learning in a Sophomore Signals and Systems Course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028480", "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper describes the experience and assessment of introducing machine learning concepts in a sophomore signals and systems course.

In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research.

Instructors of linear circuit analysis courses have traditionally relied on print textbooks for student learning materials. With the rise of student use of computers and the internet, materials like lecture slides and online videos have also been used for learning materials. Increasingly, traditional textbooks (including online formats) are experiencing a decline, while interactive textbooks are growing in popularity. This paper describes auto-graded learning tools, called challenged activities, from various topics in an online linear circuit analysis textbook. Instructors often assign challenge activities as homework. Each challenge activity has 3-5 levels of increasingly difficult problems. Each level randomly generates a question from a large set of questions of similar difficulty. Students must correctly answer a question in a level to progress to the next level. This paper describes the student usage of 4 challenge activities in an online circuit analysis textbook. The average time spent per activity was under 10 minutes and the vast majority of students who started a level ended up completing that level, indicating little attrition. In fact, most levels had 0% of students give up and the highest was only 8%, which is remarkably low based compared to more traditional paper-and-pencil activities based on the teaching experience of the authors.", "authors": [{"name": "Alex Edgcomb", "affiliation": "Research and Development zyBooks,Los Gatos,CA,USA Also with UC Riverside\u00a0"}, {"name": "Yamuna Rajasekhar", "affiliation": "Computer Science Content zyBooks,Los Gatos,CA,USA"}, {"name": "Nikitha Sambamurthy", "affiliation": "Engineering Content zyBooks,Los Gatos,CA,USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["tools", "measurement", "circuit analysis", "capacitors", "resistors", "linear circuits", "mathematical model"]}, {"title": "A Data Mining Approach to Understanding Curriculum-Level Factors That Help Students Persist and Graduate", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028488", "abstract": "This Research Full Paper describes the analysis of curriculum-level factors that affected the persistence and graduation outcomes of over 4,000 undergraduate students at San Francisco State University.

We found that students who took their first non-remedial Math course in the second year showed higher fifth-term and seventh-term persistence than students who took it in the first year. Also, students who progressed farther through their chosen or prescribed sequences consistently exhibited higher persistence and graduation rates. Furthermore, a student's persistence was a more reliable predictor of graduation than other features.

Second-chance testing, where students are allowed to take a second instance of an exam for some form of grade replacement, is a less expensive approximation of mastery-based learning that can be easily integrated into a broad range of college course structures. It encourages students to review course material after poor performance on an examination but limits the amount of resources instructors must invest in the creation of examinations or in grading them. There exists, however, a large space of potential course policies for integrating second-chance testing into a course and little prior research on how these policies affect student behavior. This paper analyzes three different grading policies in use at Midwestern University. All of the policies attempt to encourage students to prepare adequately for the first-chance exam and review the material again before the second-chance exam, if they elect to take it. The first policy used a partial grade replacement policy with insurance: students' grades could only improve by taking the second-chance exam but the first-chance exam always counts for at least one-third of a students' grade on the examination. The second policy is identical, but required students to complete a zero-credit, online-homework assignment before being allowed to take the second-chance exam. The third policy implemented full grade replacement (even if the second score is lower) and capped the score that could be achieved on the second exam. By comparing these different course policies, we show that grading policies have a significant effect on whether students take second-chance exams. We also performed a quasi-experimental study, adding second-chance exams to a course. We present data from students' exam performance and from the course's learning management system that suggest that adding a second-chance exam had no effect on student performance or study habits for the first-chance exam. However, the total amount of time that students studied did increase substantially as students who took the second-chance exam studied an additional 60% of their original effort.", "authors": [{"name": "Craig Zilles", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Department of Computer Science,USA"}, {"name": "Geoffrey Herman", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Department of Computer Science,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Kavya Varghese", "affiliation": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,Department of Computer Science,USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["education", "computer science", "solids", "organizations", "testing", "insurance", "mechanical engineering"]}, {"title": "Targeted Curricular Innovations in Data Science", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028491", "abstract": "Many employers expect skills such as proper data generation, collection, storage, and analysis; however, these skills are often not taught in the undergraduate experience.

We found that students' confidence tended to show a significant decrease across all confidence variables for all four courses, though some courses showed a stronger decrease than others. We found a similar decline pattern for gender such that males initially reported higher confidence than females, but also showed a steeper decrease in confidence after receiving final grades. This declining trend was also predicted by grades, such that individuals who earned higher grades at the end of the semester initially began the semester with higher confidence, but these individuals also showed a steeper decrease in confidence after receiving their final grades.

These numbers suggest the potential size and potential impact of the visually impaired on a day-today basis.

As a result, the demand for innovative, technology-based assistance tools that enhance the user experience and the quality of education has increased.

In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other.

In this scenario, we conducted an experimental study to investigate how the programming performance of students from the Computer Science area is affected when Software Testing is integrated with programming. We proposed three different approaches: (i) ad hoc programming; (ii) programming and testing by writing the test suite; and (iii) programming and testing with a readymade test suite. We assessed students' programs in terms of correctness, measured by the pass rate of the reference test suite. Results indicate that students had a lower performance with ad hoc programming in comparison with both approaches involving Software Testing.

Although many studies of TDD usage have been conducted in entry-level computer science courses, few have looked at more advanced students doing projects of larger scope, such as contributing to open-source software (OSS). To test the performance of the test-driven approach on OSS-based course projects, we conducted a quasi-experimental controlled study, which lasted for more than one month. Thirty-five masters students participated in our study. They worked on course projects in teams, half of which were assigned to the TDD group (using a test-driven approach), and the rest of which were assigned to the non-TDD group (using the traditional test-last approach). We found that students in the TDD group were able to apply test-driven techniques pragmatically-spending more than 20% of their time on average complying with the test-driven process-throughout the whole project. There were no major differences in the quality of source-code modifications and newly added tests between the TDD group and the non-TDD group; however, the TDD group wrote more tests and achieved significantly higher (12% more) statement coverage.", "authors": [{"name": "Zhewei Hu", "affiliation": "North Carolina State University,Department of Computer Science,Raleigh,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Yang Song", "affiliation": "University of North Carolina Wilmington,Department of Computer Science,Wilmington,USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Edward F.

Thus, this systematic literature review gathered the studies about this matter in the last six years, to reveal the approaches being used to make diagrams accessible for blind people, checking, in addition to perception, if interaction and collaboration have been considered. The initial search and screening resulted in 369 studies, out of which 26 were selected for the final analysis. The results presented the preponderance of the auditory approach followed by refreshable Braille displays to achieve perception. Concerning interaction, the keyboard was the main input interface, whereas four out of nine studies found considered it. From the four studies which treated the possibility of simultaneous users working on the diagrammatic representation, only one considered distributed collaboration.

Researchers in the field of engineering education have considered how an inclusive education model can help engineering programs increase the number of students from marginalized groups. Inclusive education environments support marginalized groups as well as majority students by enhancing student engagement in undergraduate engineering programs. Additionally, research studies have demonstrated that a growth mindset, effective instructional practice, and inclusive learning environments can support student success in engineering programs. Multiple research studies show that effective instructional practice and learning environments can facilitate authentic learning experiences in which students are actively engaged, seek deeper meaning and can apply course material. More importantly, these results of enhanced engagement are linked to higher student test scores, retention, and graduation rates (1-3). Therefore, it is important to study the relationship between faculty mindset and instructional practices that can directly impact student performance, particularly students who are underrepresented in engineering.In this paper, we report initial insight for developing the survey for engineering faculty to characterize their mindset as fixed or growth and then relate their mindset to their subsequent pedagogical choices.

Online discussions offer a number of benefits namely providing additional time to reflect and synthesize information before writing, providing a natural platform for students to voice their ideas without any one student dominating the conversation, and providing a record of the student's thoughts. An online discussion forum provides a repository comprising the discussion threads related to the topics discussed. One approach to extracting useful knowledge from the repository is through generation of concise summaries of the discussion for each topic. This summary information can help both the instructor and the student in being able to focus on the key learning points discussed in the forum threads. The focus of our research is directed towards analysis of online discussion forums (ODFs) and generating topic based summaries that can be viewed by both instructor and the students.

Research shows that using computers and other digital technologies like digital games is one way to influence young people's career aspirations and improve their digital literacy. This is particularly important as the world of work is changing and emerging jobs becoming more intensive in their use of digital technologies. In the developing world and in particular Nigeria, there have been calls to improve the digital literacy skills of young people to help them make informed career choices, and fully participate effectively and equally in the digital world. However, many of the computing and digital technology education initiatives have not produced the positive results intended. The lack of awareness, readiness and buy-in of the relevant stakeholders are some of the factors that has been identified as a barrier here. For example, for computing and digital technology-based projects in schools, the success largely depends on the support and attitude of teachers. As one of the major stakeholders in the classroom, teachers need to be consulted in decisions that affect the way they deliver their lessons; especially when novel ideas and approaches that challenge tradition are introduced. It is therefore important to consider their acceptance or otherwise of digital games in the classroom. A Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was modified to include constructs previously identified by teachers that potentially influence their intention to use digital games in the classroom. The extended TAM was developed into a questionnaire and tested with 220 teachers in Nigeria. Analyses of the results show that syllabus connectedness, perceived usefulness and self-efficacy are significant predictors of the intention of teachers to adopt digital game-based learning in the classroom. Furthermore, the teachers' demographics including experience of teaching, age and gender all mediated the intention of the teachers to use digital game-based learning. The results and findings present recommendations for school leaders and developers of digital educational games. The practical insights from this are also important here and helpful for guiding the deployment of such games particularly in areas where such technological interventions have not been used before.", "authors": [{"name": "Emma V.

Most of the previous infographics studies have been conducted in the context of inquiry learning. To complement this research, we studied how learners experience use of infographics as a method for reflective assignment and hence if the usage of infographics supported conceptualization about RE. We adopted a qualitative content analysis approach, applying thematic network analysis to the data received from five case learners. This approach proposes graphical networks as an aid for analyzing and synthesizing qualitative data into basic, organizing, and global themes. The thematic network analysis produced two global, seven organizational, and 53 basic themes. The global themes were named \u201cVisual literacy\u201d and \u201cConceptualization\u201d. In addition, the e-course supervisor evaluated learners' infographics according to assessment criteria. Based on these analyses, learners can, using infographics, concentrate on essential topics, distill information, and develop their skills for visual literacy and conceptualization.

The core programming concepts are topics typically covered in CS1 (and often in CS0), including input/output, variables, branching, loops, arrays, and functions. Usually, programming is introduced with an industry language, such as Java or Python, which were developed for professionals, not for students. Sometimes, programming is introduced visually, such as Scratch or Alice, but many instructors want a more serious feel for college students, writing textual code. Our content teaches programming using an ultra-simple language, Coral, designed specifically to teach core concepts. The content presents a Coral program as code or a flowchart that closely resembles the code's structure. Each chapter starts by introducing the programming concept visually with flowchart examples, so students develop a strong ability to read a program and understand how the program executes. Later in the chapter, the content introduces the corresponding textual code. The student then writes code to solve homework problems. Such incremental learning (first master program reading, then master program writing) is a key feature. Another key feature is a strong emphasis on visualization and intuition: The content uses animations that show Coral programs being executed line-by-line, along with variables shown in memory, including variable value updates from assignments. Further, the content has an online educational simulator where a student or instructor can write and execute Coral code. This paper includes early student usage data, such as amount of time spent to complete learning and homework, that shows students can quickly learn programming concepts.

Previous work in areas that are more common was reviewed and the most relevant pedagogy development methodology of Understanding by Design\u00ae (UbD\u2122) [1, 2] was utilized to build a curriculum for a team of experienced faculty. The authors consist of experienced faculty trained in both the subject area and with experience working in these areas, in addition to advanced degrees in the subject area and technical education. Undergraduate students aided the authors who are well versed in technical subjects as well as some educational techniques. The UbD\u2122 development of this work is a multi-step process, working backwards. The first step is to recognize the major outcomes for the curriculum and individual courses, and then develop a means to assess the items in this list. After this list is developed a varying level of detail can be utilized to assure that these goals for the courses are met. In the case of this project the desires of the experienced faculty were utilized to develop topics and an overview of lab topics that would support the course objectives and also meet faculty expectations. After this is completed the objectives can be checked against accreditation goals to assure, they are met and then work to either find or recommend various resources to support in class learning tasks. The result of this organized progression is a thorough and well-presented curriculum These steps are shared in-depth view in this paper so that duplication by others in engineering technology or outside of engineering technology may develop new and less common curriculum for their programs.

The changes of the projects has been based by reflecting on these insights. These reflections are described and several recommendations are drawn from the experiences. These include, that it is important that the cohorts collaborate and work together in parallel. Individual groups, of diverse cohorts, should work in isolation.

Forming student teams that are more likely to be successful is a goal of every teacher or instructor using teams as a part of their pedagogy. CATME is a team formation and team management website tool. It contains team formation, peer evaluation and teamwork training tools to help an instructor make and manage student teams. CATME's team building algorithms include validated teamwork research with practical constraints provided by instructors.CATME's Team-Maker algorithm uses a heuristic score based on instructor-determined criteria to form teams that optimize the student team composition. The tool includes 20 built-in questions for the instructor to choose from with the option to create individual questions. One question type not accounted for in the current CATME algorithm is a preference ranking question.Augmenting the Team-Maker algorithm to include student project preference as a part of the heuristic score will ease the time struggle of instructors while still forming well-balanced groups.

The construct of intelligence is salient in engineering education and academic culture more broadly; however, the beliefs that individuals hold about intelligence are very personal and often remain implicit. We are driven to understand students' beliefs about intelligence as extant research has demonstrated that these beliefs can impact student motivation and persistence in academic settings. Beliefs or perceptions about intelligence and smartness have also been linked to the exclusionary nature of engineering as a field. Data was collected in the form of written responses and audio recordings from a focus group and an interview with undergraduate engineering students, including both first-year and senior students. Participants were asked to provide written responses to questions related to their perceptions of intelligence and smartness. In addition to collecting individual responses, the focus group also allowed for open dialogue among participants to present their perceptions of intelligence and to discuss their beliefs. Analysis of our data was guided by the following research question: What are the different ways that undergraduate engineering students describe intelligence and smartness? The participants' written responses pertaining to how they perceive intelligence as a function of time (Worksheet 1) and how they conceptualize smartness (Worksheet 2) were analyzed by identifying major similarities and differences.

In this study, we investigate the engineering identity profiles of incoming low-SES, high-achieving engineering students. We interviewed 13 students using a protocol focused on understanding the students' engineering identity profiles before entering engineering school. An integrated model of engineering identity development was used to frame the research and guide the analysis. Our preliminary results show existing pre-college identity-related patterns across students as well as initial ways of identifying with their major and engineering as a field.

Senioritis is a known ailment that affects the best of students, often rendering them unproductive, depressed, and despondent. Nearly all have experienced this affliction to one extent or another, sometimes as it relates to academia and other times as it relates to particular situations or experiences in which one is involved.The instructor and grader of a required course, most often taken by senior students towards the end of their studies, noticed serious issues in students possibly experiencing this ailment and wondered what the group of students were reacting to. When asked, the students were vague, and not particularly engaged in providing an answer. The instructor asked if the students would be willing to provide a quick write up explaining what they were experiencing, and how they were reacting to it. The answer was affirmative, with the students expressing an interest in learning what other students were experiencing as well. Most students indicated that they felt they were the only one having motivation issues, as students, in general, do not talk about it. Although they did indicate some of their close friends had similar issues. The student's experiences were formulated via an in-class reflective assignment, where students were asked to keep the response to one page or less and asked the following question below:\u201cTell me how senioritis affected you this semester. How did you approach things difrerently and how did you feel about school in general?\u201dThe results from this were not surprising, but significant in the reasons they cited for their issues. Students expressed gratitude for the opportunity to think about what was going on and this compelled them to work through some of the issues they encountered. The instructor and grader found that after this activity some of the students were able to work more effectively and responded more positively as their time in the classroom was coming to a close. This paper will present the results of this informal, in-class study examined using content analysis techniques intended to probe the reflective assignment responses for themes and issues students encounter at this time in their academic career.

Specifically, this paper explores the use of in-code comments as an approach to support students' learning process and development of abstraction skills in an introductory programming course at the undergraduate level. Computer programming is a difficult skill to learn by novices due to the complexity of multiple elements interacting with each other to produce a specific outcome. Providing worked-examples paired with an engaging pedagogical practice has demonstrated to be an effective strategy for novices to start learning complex topics such as computer programming. One of the strategies that can support the introduction of worked examples is the use of self-explanation activities. In the context of programming, using in-code comments as a way for students to self-explain programming code can support the integration of worked-examples to scaffold their learning process. In this study, students wrote comments to explain how worked examples that were provided completed a specific task. Their comments were scored using an assessment rubric to provide detailed feedback about regarding the quality of their comments and their understanding of the code beyond the line by line execution. The goal of this study is to explore whether students with prior exposure to computer programming generate better self-explanations, and the effect that the quality of the written explanations and students' prior programming experiences have on student overall performance in the introductory programming course.

Asynchronous discussions are an important part of each e-learning system since they allow students to choose when they will be included in the discussion. Numerous studies specifically encourage student-student discussion in which students are freer to express their opinion than in a professor-student discussion moderated by a professor. The sample consists of 135 students, 75 of whom are students of ZSEM, and 60 of them are from FTS. All of them are in the first year of their college education. The analyzed discussions are conducted in the Learning Management System (LMS) Moodle on courses English Language (FTS) and Information and Communication Technologies (ZSEM). Student-student discussions are in English (FTS) and in Croatian (ZSEM). The methodological approach taken was to measure the amount of Netspeak elements in the discussion. Netspeak is a language form that generates itself from a spoken and a symbolic language. It is developing very rapidly and through the use of new technologies such as Skype, Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp, etc. Its main feature is the extensive use of abbreviations, emoticons, and punctuation. In order to conduct quantitative analysis, the methodology for measuring the frequency in using Netspeak elements through ten standards was used. These standards are divided into four following groups: standard related to information and communication technology (ICT), Grammar and syntax (G), Prosody (P) and Others (O). The difference in the use of Netspeak elements will be analyzed between both groups, particularly differences between the type of standards used, between different languages and genders. Also, the correlation between using Netspeak elements and the final grade on the course will be calculated. It is expected that both groups of students will have Netspeak elements in their discussions, but that there will be some differences in the standards they use.", "authors": [{"name": "Vesna Bulatovic", "affiliation": "Faculty of Technical Sciences,Novi Sad,Serbia\u00a0"}, {"name": "Karmela Aleksic-Maslac", "affiliation": "Zagreb School of Economics and Management,Zagreb,Croatia\u00a0"}, {"name": "Zdravka Biocina", "affiliation": "Zagreb School of Economics and Management,Zagreb,Croatia"}], "tags": ["standards", "education", "grammar", "correlation", "information and communication technology", "discussion forums", "economics"]}, {"title": "A Comparison of Peer Rating Behavior Between Students in Hard vs. Soft Disciplines", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028576", "abstract": "This Work in Progress research focuses on the peer ratings behavior of students in liberal arts and business, versus engineering or the sciences and is relevant wherever teams are used as part of the pedagogy, We examine whether there are differences in patterns of peer rating behavior due to differences in their particular learning experiences and learning style preferences, as measured by their patterns in evaluations in peer ratings surveys.

Careers in computer science continue to grow, but fewer women than men are even considering these careers. Increasing participation of women in coding/programming is necessary to meet the growing demand for computing professionals to develop a diverse workforce. Today, many organizations are implementing programming coding/programming academies/camps that attempt to engage students in computer science, at an early age, by exposing them to fun and interesting computer science skills in coding/programming. We have developed a coding/programming academy that uses educational robotics and hands-on game applications to demonstrate computing concepts to young females. To address pressing equity issues of the lack of females in computer science careers, the goal of this summer coding/programming academy was to educate and empower young females, at an early age, to discover computer science careers, which has been one of the first attempts to establish a coding/programming academy for females in our region. Our coding/programming academy differs from others in several ways. First, it was for 6th-grade females only, to take advantage of preferences of noncompetitive and social learning opportunities, in order to improve female participation. Second, we hired female instructors and invited female professionals from local industries to assist the academy by serving as mentors. Third, it introduced both robotic and game coding/programming to the females. Fourth, it adopted social learning, e.g., pair programming. A formal assessment of the 2018 academy found that the academy's female participants experienced a significant increase in knowledge and interest in computer science. This paper describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the coding/programming academy. It describes how the academy was organized and taught, which includes a brief description of the instructional materials, the concepts taught in each hands-on session, how the academy was assessed and the assessment results, and the first-year experience of conducting the coding/programming academy, and lessons learned.

The instructor gained valuable insight into teaching methods through university instructional excellence programs and applied them to this interdisciplinary graduate course.

This course originated from the need to develop a core graduate curricula appropriate for students in electrical, mechanical and aviation/transportation technologies. To date we have also included similar engineering disciplines, computer graphics, economics and engineering education students. A generic instrumentation system is described from which students specify the needs of their research projects to develop and evaluate their own instrumentation systems. The same approaches are then applied to quantify the system errors. This provides a very student centered environment which students appreciated. The wide variety of disciplines also provides unique opportunities for team development and dynamics.

The statistics on the number of students who graduate from university \u201con-time\u201d makes one wonder if the four-year completion rate is a myth. In reality, some statistics show less than a third graduate in four years, and almost half graduate by six years. Several reasons lead to needing more years to graduate. For example, graduation may be delayed due to the extra time required to repeat a failed or dropped course. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive methods for college students to analyze datasets on graduation rates and the effects on other aspects of their lives. In this paper, we examine whether an interactive visualization tool can inform students about the short-term and long-term life effects for extending their graduation from four years to five, six, or more years. The benefit for students to use this tool is to give them a holistic understanding of how their current time in college affects future opportunities. In addition, college mentors and advisers can share this tool with students during advising sessions. We assume our primary audience is a computer science major from \u201cAnonymized University\u201d and aggregate various datasets to design and implement an interactive visualization tool, called \u201cGraduated Life Explore.\u201d This tool helps students explore different motivational reasons on the advantages of graduating, as well as the possible risks and disadvantages of delaying their college graduation. We discuss several benefits including net costs, extracurricular activities, financial aid possibilities, career opportunities, retirement plans, health insurance, and more. These reasons are represented and encoded into our interactive visualization tool which employs multiple coordinated views on different datasets including timeline pie charts with interactive pop out charts. We explore the effectiveness of this interactive visualization tool through a usability study on students at \u201cAnonymized University\u201d.", "authors": [{"name": "Nithya Gubbala", "affiliation": "California State University, Sacramento,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Sacramento,CA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Anna Baynes", "affiliation": "California State University, Sacramento,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Sacramento,CA"}], "tags": ["tools", "usability", "switches", "computer science", "market research", "visualization", "data visualization"]}, {"title": "Effect of controlling group heterogeneity on student performance in a graphical programming course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028593", "abstract": "This study assesses whether students perform better in an introductory programming course if they are placed in groups with people of the same or varying programming aptitude. Although the push for teaching code in U.S K-12 classrooms is growing, students arrive to college with a variety of coding experience because only not all schools include coding in their curriculum. Understanding what makes a group productive and efficient is important as the use of active-learning pedagogies across college classrooms grows. The studies presented here aim to 1) predict how well a student will perform in an introductory programming course based on a pre-assessment administered at the beginning of the course and 2) determine whether students perform better in an introductory programming course if they participate in team based projects with people of the same or varying programming aptitude. During the first week of class, students were administered a pre-assessment. Their score determined individual student programming aptitude. Students were assigned to groups based on their performance, where control groups consisted of students who only scored as high programming aptitude or only scored low programming aptitude, and experimental teams consisted of a mix of both. Evidence was found to indicate that the group formation pre-assessment was a good indicator of programming aptitude. It was also found that when completing individual tasks, students who were placed in groups with students of varying programming aptitude outperformed those who were placed in groups with students of the same programming aptitude. The positive findings and their effect on students' abilities to learn a programming language demonstrated that the technique of a short assessment and assigned groups may become an important tool to create more effective groups in large introductory programming courses. Although further testing is required, this technique may shape the future of group formation in large programming courses.", "authors": [{"name": "Christine E.

The study used an electroencephalograph (EEG) and self-report data to investigate students' cognitive load and performance when completing concept mapping and listing tasks related to complex issues like food security and water availability. The study was designed to test two hypotheses: first, concept maps allow individuals to organize their thoughts using a networked or systems thinking framework, and thus will result in a more complete and holistic response than listing tasks; and second, creating a concept map is a more complex cognitive process and thus students will experience greater cognitive load during concept mapping tasks than listing tasks. Twenty-seven students at a mid-size public university participated in the study, which is an adequate size for EEG data analysis. For each participant, over forty pieces of data were recorded, including: demographic data, responses to the Revised Systems Thinking Scale, order effects, EEG performance variables, NASA-TLX scores, listing task metrics, and concept map scores. The paper presents and discusses quantitative results related to three questions: (1) do students perform better on listing or concept mapping tasks? (2) do students exert more mental effort (cognitive load) for listing or concept mapping? (3) how did performance compare across different direct and self-report measures? The ultimate goal of this research is to create learning approaches that enhance students' cognitive resources to meet and exceed the requirements of working within the sustainable design paradigm.

Possible solutions to overcome the challenges and provide support for the development of context-aware systems is the use of reference architectures (RA) and service-oriented architectures (SOA). RA is a software architecture that can be applied to build architectures of specific domain systems, supporting the development of system families. SOA is an architectural style that provides functionalities encapsulated in Web services, which make it easier the integration of dynamic adaptive behavior into the applications. Therefore, this paper presents oriented RA to assist the development of context-aware ubiquitous learning environments, characterized by their ability to obtain and use information from the users' context. This enables the software to adapt the behavior, services or didactic resources, in accordance with the context where learning is taking place (e.g., location, time, student preference, etc.). The presented RA, named MOA, can be instantiated to develop specific context-aware learning environments. MOA was built based on ProSA-RA, which is a RA development process, and evaluated using the checklist technique. Also, a prototype was built to illustrate MOA instantiation.

In general, faculty development programme could be grouped into three major clusters viz., (a) Refresher courses (b) Pedagogy & Technology tool courses and (c) Instructional Pedagogy courses. In the refresher courses, the latest development in the content area is provided and there is gain in better insight to the faculty members. In the case of pedagogy and technology tools courses, the main focus is understanding the nuances of pedagogy and implementation through integrating technology tools in the classroom. The third category of training is purely integrated and focus how to deliver the content in accordance to the fundamental principles of teaching and they mostly focus on particular subject with focus on how to deliver it. The concept of faculty development programme predominantly adopted by the faculty members in the government sector due to stipulated review mechanism for promotion, however there exists a void in attending the programme by the faculty members working in private institutions. The major constraint seems to be course fee, permission from the education institute and location of the training programme. In order to address the constraint and to adopt inclusive approach in providing training to all the faculty members both government and private sector, blended approach was adopted. At NITTTR Chennai, training programme to faculty members in the area of instructional design and delivery was carried out through blended mode. The framework was designed to enhance the effectiveness of the training programme. The nodal centers were connected through online lecturing followed by face to face lecture in the end of the training programme.

Technology and online games are increasingly being used in engineering education to help students gain competencies in technical domains in the engineering field. Less is known about the way that these online games are designed and incorporated into the classroom environment and how these factors can ignite inequitable perspectives and experiences among engineering students. Also, little if any work that combines the TAM model and intersectionality of race and gender in engineering education has been done, though several studies have been modified to account for gender or race. This study expands upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by exploring perspectives of intersectional groups (defined as women of color who are engineering students). A Mixed Method Sequential Exploratory Research Design approach was used that extends the TAM model. Students were asked to play the engineering educational game, complete an open-ended questionnaire and then to participate in a focus group. Early findings suggest that while many students were open to learning to use the game and recommended inclusion of online engineering educational games as learning tools in classrooms, only a few indicated that they would use this tool to prepare for exams or technical job interviews. Some of the main themes identified in this study included unintended perpetuation of inequality through bias in favor of students who enjoyed competition-based learning and assessment of knowledge, and bias for students having prior experience in playing online games. Competition-based assessment related to presumed learning of course content enhanced student anxiety and feelings of intimidation and led to some students seeking to \u201cgame the game\u201d versus learning the material, in efforts to achieve grade goals. Other students associated use of the game and the classroom weighted grading with intense stress that led them to prematurely stop the use of the engineering tool.

The senior exit survey data consist of the categorical responses to the department's questions from the graduating class from the years 2013-2018. The collected data contain specific information such as student's name, the year they started, career outlook, and individual capabilities.

This paper introduces a multi-program assessment system for a department offering multiple majors to seek accreditation from ABET CAC and EAC. The Canvas LMS is our mandated tool for faculty to set up course rubrics, assign grades, and communicate with students. However, it falls short on solving several of our data issues, including data retrieval, data separation, data sharing, data integration, and data security. The Canvas LMS provides no data download for individual rubric criteria of an instrument, hindering analysis to a more granular level. There is also no information to identify a student's major, making data separation for different academic programs difficult. Faculty are reluctant to share student data on Canvas for integration, worrying about a violation to FERPA. Moreover, data sharing and data integration can increase the risk of data security. Our assessment system is built atop of Canvas and is a service oriented web application for faculty to assess student performance and generate instrument reports. The reports reveal only computed statistics for data sharing, integration and security purposes. The provided web services can interact with another system to distinguish student majors and consolidate instruments whose rubric criteria cover the same performance indicators (PIs).

At a large Midwestern university, a robotics cornerstone design project is offered. This project-based and collaborative learning project involves teams designing an autonomous robot. The teams are self-driven and must utilize time and project management skills. To create the teams of four, a team formation survey is administered to the students via the CATME team formation software. Students self-identify levels of prior experience with robotics and technical skills, and levels of preference about leadership, ideas, and details. The instructional staff does not impose specific roles upon team members, but teams are formed so that each team can complete all elements. Anecdotally, this model has allowed for the emergence of both leaders and social loafers within the groups. Students who exhibit leadership qualities keep their teammates on task and schedule, maintain communication and participation, and ensure teammates get help when needed. Students who exhibit characteristics of social loafing, a term used in social psychology, put forth fewer ideas and less effort, require more direction to complete tasks, and do not communicate as well with the team. The absence of leadership or the presence of social loafing can hinder a team's performance and detract from the student experience. Thus, the instructional staff is interested in identifying potential leaders and social loafers on teams early so that appropriate guidance can be given to improve the experience. Throughout the project, students also complete peer evaluations and submit weekly timesheets.

This paper presents a comparative study between two different user interface implementations for iVProg: context menu against fixed menu. Each interface have different ways to delivery the resources to users. Moreover, both of them use point-and-click mouse interaction in order to allow the user to develop algorithms. Usability tests were performed with undergraduate students to identify users' awareness concerning their effort and performance while interacting with the system. Students enrolled in a summer introductory programming course were invited to participate of usability tests. The attendees were divided in two groups, one group started using the fixed menu and the other with context menu. In the second session, the groups inverted the utilized interface. The study analyzed different instruments: the mouse log, NASA-TLX workload perception data, also an unstructured interview, that was conducted in order to identify students' perception about their experience with iVProg. When analyzed visually, logs of mouse clicks obtained in the introductory programming course showed that the construction of algebraic and logical expressions required a higher number of interactions in both interface versions. Although students found the fixed menu interface less mental demanding, the overall workload of the fixed menu interface was much higher when compared to the context menu.

Over the last decade, many studies have been conducted concerning university-industry engagement which chart the landscape of activities, educational approaches, and challenges that students face when involved in industry-related activities. Despite the existing close collaboration between Swedish engineering universities and industry, it seems that not only the feedback from the industry to universities is missing, but also students' perceptions of their industry experience and their needs are not taken adequately into consideration by the other two actors. As a consequence, there is a gap among the above three actors preventing the advancement of engineering education in terms of industrial interventions. Furthermore, there is a lack of research about students' perceptions of university-industry engagement activities. This study adopts a qualitative and exploratory research perspective, intending to gain a deep understanding of students' perceptions of industry-related activities which were integrated into their education. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine master's students studying on five-year long engineering programmes in a large research-intensive Swedish university. An inductive thematic analysis was employed, and social cognitive theory was considered as an interpretive tool through which to explore student motivation. The interviews indicated that the students participated actively in various industry-related activities, such as guest lectures, field-trips, internships, summer schools, and masters' theses in collaboration with industry partners which give context to the findings which highlight how industry-related activities can either positively or negatively affect students' motivation for studying and learning in engineering education.", "authors": [{"name": "Panagiotis Pantzos", "affiliation": "KTH Royal Intitute of Technology,Dept. of Learning in Engineering Sciences,Stockholm,Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Arnold Pears", "affiliation": "KTH Royal Intitute of Technology,Dept. of Learning in Engineering Sciences,Stockholm,Sweden"}, {"name": "Lena Gumaelius", "affiliation": "KTH Royal Intitute of Technology,Dept. of Learning in Engineering Sciences,Stockholm,Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jeffrey Buckley", "affiliation": "KTH Royal Intitute of Technology,Dept. of Learning in Engineering Sciences,Stockholm,Sweden\u00a0"}], "tags": ["industries", "collaboration", "interviews", "engineering students", "problem-solving"]}, {"title": "Enhancing Critical Thinking in Engineering by Incorporating an E-assignment and Peer Review in a Blended Learning Course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028622", "abstract": "This Innovative Practice Category Work in Progress Paper presents the design and implementation of an online writing assignment as a critical component to the blended learning approach in designing a Power System Course to enhance student learning and pique their interest.

Circuits is a common engineering course, foundational to electrical engineering, but taken by many students in other disciplines due to the content being part of the Fundamentals of Engineering examination. Given the fact that most electrical phenomena are not experienced directly or causally in everyday life and that the phenomena arise from interactions between charges, the concepts that underlie circuit behavior are emergent rather than direct. Misperceptions of emergent concepts are robust due to students day-to-day experiences with more direct concepts. To develop correct conceptual understandings it has been hypothesized that it is necessary to let students explore misconceptions in a causal, i.e. cause and effect, way. To enable students to explore phenomena of electric circuits in a causal way this work-in-progress paper outlines development of a puzzle-format game platform which enables a wide variety of conceptual problems to be posed and player solutions recorded. Briefly the game builds in visual elements on the Unity development platform to represent both potential and current. Game developers pose puzzles, similar to problems on existing circuits concept inventories, that players solve by wiring a level-defined set of electronic components. A novel feature of the game platform is the use of a SPICE\u00ae engine to allow in-game computation of many circuit configurations.

In previous work, we developed a process for generating profiles of role models that reflected the values of the population the role models were serving (underrepresented minority students in STEM). In short, we performed qualitative emergent thematic analysis on focus group data from underrepresented minorities in STEM to identify the qualities this population valued in role models. These qualities were used to develop a survey for potential role models (STEM alumni of the same institution) and the survey was subsequently used to develop profiles for the role model candidates. These profiles were well received by our original focus group participants. We have since run an analogous study at another institution using nearly the same survey to develop profiles of potential mentors. Here the mentors are upperclassmen, and the population they are serving includes all students in introductory STEM courses, though we remain particularly interested in underrepresented minorities. In this paper we present a simple textual comparison of the two sets of profiles as a first step in a comparative analysis of these profiles.

This approach also facilitates assessment of the student design abilities. Design thinking is a well-known process for problem solving. However, when used in engineering literacy courses for non-engineering majors, the outcomes of the ideation stage are severely constrained by the student's internal technological knowledge base. Student design thinking exercises can result in technologically vague concepts. Liberal arts students from non-technical disciplines become frustrated and see the design process as suspect and fail to embrace a multidimensional perspective on design. Non-engineering students lack critical engineering science knowledge relevant to the problem but the nature of engineering literacy courses for non-engineers precludes in-depth mathematics-based engineering science prerequisites. We have found that the platform of technological domains effective in supporting students between the innovation of design thinking and the empowerment of engineering science. Technological systems form clusters or domains of related systems around a set of shared components based on similar underlying physical principles, for example, vapor-compression refrigeration systems. We have found that students benefit if design exercises are conducted in the context of a technological domain. In the work reported here, students studied the familiar domestic refrigerator as typifying the technology enabled by the engineering science underlying the vapor-compression cycle. Students were then presented with a design challenge involving a cooling application but different from the function of a domestic kitchen refrigerator.

In collaboration with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), the research team served as both instructors and researchers in a professional development (PD) session to teach a group of 45 Latinx engineering faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students from across the United States about how to uncover HC and strategies needed to translate these concepts in their instruction and other responsibilities as engineering educators. As a follow-up, a subset of attendees from the original PD, completed a mixed-method survey about HC. Using the frameworks of HC, engineering identity, and critical literacy, the research group analyzed the written qualitative responses.

This initiative is designed in three phases: the pilot phase, the alliance phase, and the backbone phase. This project is aimed at the pilot phase; however, its focus does not end when the piloting is over, but rather, it is intended to integrate with other pilot programs into building regional alliances. Through the regional alliances, this proposed pilot initiative is planned to become part of the national backbone program, which aims at producing well-prepared, underrepresented graduates into the STEM-related workforce. Because the percentage of women and minorities (African-American, Hispanics, and Native Americans) in STEM-related workforce is so small, the COESIND program is designed to broaden the participation of these groups. To do so, a community of the eight campuses of Chattahoochee Technical College, the five campuses of Georgia-Perimeter College, the Girls, Inc. of Greater Atlanta, Georgia, Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of Greater Atlanta, and three area high schools in Cobb County, all in the metropolitan area of Atlanta, Georgia, will participate in the COESIND program. A Kennesaw State University (KSU) CS mentorship program, The Girls, Inc.'s summer camps have consistently attracted several girls over the years (Google IgniteCS). These institutions, collectively, have a significantly large population of African-American (A-A), Hispanics, and Girls/Women. Faculty from the College of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE) and College of Engineering at KSU, located in Kennesaw, Georgia, will lead the proposed program. KSU, which recently merged with Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU), located in Marietta, Georgia, now has a student population of 5,000 in these two Colleges. Moreover, KSU was recently classified as an R2 institution. The University also offers an array of STEM programs and has been ranked 7th among institutions that offer online courses and, at the time the merger, SPSU was ranked among the top three producers of African-American engineering technology graduates in the nation. With its prior implementations of two NSF-LSAMP programs, among other undergraduate-level student training, KSU is qualified to lead such an initiative. Our focus on Computing and Engineering sub-disciplines, among the many STEM-fields, is intentional: To focus on programs and activities where computing and engineering technologies are deployed as tools to solving real-world problems.

We aim to answer the following questions: How will employment opportunities for transportation engineers evolve in the coming 5-10 years? How will the work that transportation engineers perform on a day-to-day basis evolve in the coming 510 years, both in private-sector and public-sector organizations? What topics should graduate-level transportation engineering curricula include in the future, such that the students develop the skills to be successful in the transportation sector of the next 5-10 years? Our investigation consists of in-depth one on one interviews with a range of academics involved in the teaching of graduate level transportation engineering courses and practitioners working in the field who have participated in the hiring of transportation engineers. We will be asking questions about the current and future needs of the field and the professionals within it. We will then compare the responses to current transportation engineering graduate programs' learning outcomes. This comparison will allow us to make recommendations for changes to established programs and to inform the creation of future programs.", "authors": [{"name": "Meg West", "affiliation": "The Ohio State University,Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geodetic Engineering,Columbus,Ohio\u00a0"}, {"name": "Andre Carrel", "affiliation": "The Ohio State University,Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geodetic Engineering,Columbus,Ohio"}], "tags": ["transportation", "employment", "history", "interviews", "engineering students"]}, {"title": "Integrating Professional Tools in Programming Education with MOOCs", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028643", "abstract": "An increasing number of high school teachers use existing Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) concerning programming education. Most MOOCs focus on teaching the basics of a programming language and common concepts or patterns. MOOC platforms usually provide their own code execution environments and thus have full control over the features and appearance available to learners. However, only a subset of tools available to professional software engineers is used in introductory programming MOOCs. While the reduction of features is helpful to ease navigation for novices, we assume that learners benefit from more advanced features at a later stage in the learning process. To help students minimize bugs and conceptual mistakes, we intend to evaluate how pair programming could be enabled for remote peers in MOOCs with a synchronized editor and an additional communication channel. Further, we plan to use static program analysis to get more insights about the code written by learners and to provide early feedback about the coding style.

To address this issue, we proposed to focus on the application of the image processing theories in a real industrial problem, through a computer vision pipeline.

To evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology, students answered a questionnaire about their satisfaction. Based on these answers we map how much it helps the undergraduate students to understand the implications of different image processing concepts in a real environment.

Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews.

The main goal of this review is to identify the basic mathematics topics in which students face most difficulties. This tough relationship with mathematics begins a long time before the university, it can be identified at the first levels, during basic education, when students are introduced to arithmetic. According to studies, in most cases, there are two kinds of problems that can explain this learning difficulty: the first one is identified when it is related to the child's cognitive development, while the second kind of common learning difficulty is related to problems outside the child or in another particular problem. Also, it has been identified in the literature that when studying mathematics, a range of feelings can be triggered in students, ranging from positive feelings to negative ones. This perception can explain why students with a history of failures in mathematics believe that they are not able to construct the necessary knowledge to pursue higher education in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) courses. In Brazil, for instance, only 17% of students apply for a STEM course, while in countries in North America and Europe, this percentage reaches 24%. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted in order to analyze publications regarding difficulties related to basic math, faced by students in higher education. The results indicate various difficulty levels in a variety of mathematics topics, including functions and fractions in practical situations.

Higher education institutions need to provide a wide range of engineers with an increasing level of cross-disciplinary skills. An active, local presence of a university providing degree programs and research in technology has a strong link with the volume and development of the technology industry in the region. While modern technologies, especially information and communication technology (ICT), allow research and development activities to be independent of the location, other sectors of technology industry, such as maritime industry, require significant investments in physical facilities, bound to the region. Governments face two main challenges to maintain their industry's engineering competitiveness: (1) to prepare engineering graduates across expanding ranges of skills and knowledge, and (2) to provide the engineers in the regions where these skills are needed. Southwestern Finland is a region with the fastest growing technology industry in the country. Without a university with a full range of opportunities for academic engineering education in the region, there is an increasing number of job openings that cannot be filled. In Finland, students in engineering connect with the industry already during their studies and, after graduation, tend to stay in the region where they studied. To expose engineering students to the challenges of Southwestern Finland without creating new permanent higher education engineering structures in the region, the Finnish government in 2017 launched FITech, a 5-year project including all the seven Finnish universities offering engineering education.

Effective grading involves maintaining consistency among all students, irrespective of gender, race, ethnic background, and prior performance. Related work in this area has shown that prior work submitted by a student influences future scores given. Some of the popular methods used to eliminate grading bias involves grading rubrics, anonymous or blind grading, and/or computerized auto-graders. In spite of all these methods, some types of grading such as essays and projects still require subjective grading, which opens the door to conscious or unconscious bias. Given the student data available regarding performance, colleges and universities are turning to analytic solutions to extract meaning from huge volumes of student data to help improve retention, graduation, and student performance rates. While looking at all the analytic options can be a daunting task, these analytic options can be categorized at a high level into three distinct types: (a) Descriptive Analytics, which use data aggregation and data mining to provide insight into the past and answer \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d; (b) Predictive Analytics, which use statistical models and forecasts techniques to understand the future and answer \u201cWhat could happen?\u201d; and (c) Prescriptive Analytics, which use optimization and simulation algorithms to advise on possible outcomes and answer \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d In this paper, we use Prescriptive Analytics to provide students with advice on what action to take, based on a tool which predicts each student's performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Ashwin Satyanarayana", "affiliation": "New York City College of Technology (of The City University of New York),Computer Systems Technology,Brooklyn,US\u00a0"}, {"name": "Reneta Lansiquot", "affiliation": "New York City College of Technology (of The City University of New York),English,Brooklyn,US\u00a0"}, {"name": "Christine Rosalia", "affiliation": "Hunter College (of The City University of New York),Curriculum and Instruction,New York,US"}], "tags": ["tools", "predictive models", "urban areas", "computational modeling", "computer science", "data analysis", "data models"]}, {"title": "Fostering Problem Understanding as a Precursor to Problem-Solving in Computer Programming", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028664", "abstract": "In this research to practice full paper we quantified student understanding of computer programming problems, and correlated it with their ability to write viable computer programs.

Nevertheless, such kind of tools might be under criticism of reproducibility and lack scalability. Additionally, it is difficult to provide real-time feedback based on such measurements since they require active participation and longer data collection processes. These factors thereby deter educational practitioners who wish to utilize SRL-based pedagogy in larger classrooms. To make SRL research more accessible to educational practitioners, we propose to use quantitative analysis based on trace data to measure potential SRL behaviors from two aspects: study persistence and study regularity, which we assume are implicit measurement of SRL. We conducted the experiment in an undergraduate computer science course by a homegrown self-assessment platform, QuizIt and successfully identified four types of study persistence. The study regularity is measured as scores and associated in a linear regression model. The evaluation based on students' formal exam scores in the course shows that high persistence and regular behaviors are positively correlated to exam performance.

Flipped classroom is a pedagogical approach that has received a significant research attention in recent times. Yet, current studies have not explored the effect of instructional methods, made available by internet and multimedia technologies, on students' performance in flipped classroom. This creates a gap in both the knowledge and practice of flipped classroom. In our effort to fill this gap and contribute to knowledge, we designed an exploratory study to investigate how each of the five instructional methods used in engineering education affect students' performance in a flipped classroom. Accordingly, we registered 35 students into an Information Systems (IS) core course and divided them into two classes (identified using their section codes, 01 and 1E) taught by the same professor. Class 01 (the experimental group) was taught with a flipped model while Class 1E (the control group) was taught with the traditional model. Data was collected from two sources, students' grades and questionnaire responses. After analyzing the data, we made some findings that would be useful to professors practicing flipped classroom. We summarize the key findings as follows: (a) Instructional methods that are interactive, interdependent and peer-focused are most preferred by students and offer greater learning experience. (b) Students who indicated Connect Interactive as their most preferred instructional method, in flipped classroom, performed better than their peers by a range of 25%. We consider this study to be exploratory in nature because of its relatively small sample size.

Group Work is a didactic that has the objective of promoting learning and that can be of diverse natures. One of the determining factors for its success is the applied composition strategy, which may or may not favor the construction of knowledge of different profiles of learners. On the other hand, the task of composing groups of learners based on their cognitive performance, without the use of a support tool, can be very time-consuming. Therefore, the Pedagogical Architectures then emerge as teaching-learning structures that are made of several components which have the function of facilitating the interactions in an environment of autonomous action and collaborative construction. Teaching strategies that provide the learner with situations of questioning and imbalance are recognized as effective for the construction of new knowledge. However, leaving the responsibility for provoking such situations only to the teachers, overloads them. Therefore, we propose the Debate of Maps as a new instantiation of Pedagogical Architectures that uses concept maps as form of representation and sharing of knowledge in place of discursive responses in the debate dynamics. A tool was designed and added to a concept mapping service platform. Two experiments were carried out in the classroom environment, allowing a deep analysis on the application of the PA and tool.

These different perspectives of the same system can be a powerful technique to facilitate the analysis of requirements about the system. Using a virtual reality environment allows for the linking of multiple perspectives from the separate analysis models to be viewed in three dimensions. This approach can be particularly beneficial to students in learning how to analyze models by providing a mechanism to examine the visual relationship between the perspectives. Using this approach allows the student to view, create, manipulate, and alter models within the native three-dimensional space, which can provide an indepth experience better suited for learning. The virtual reality environment also allows models to be nested to provide better abstractions and layered to provide a level of complexity impossible to replicate in the traditional two-dimensional space.

The authors provide two examples of such devices in this paper to illustrate the classification of instructional IoT devices into subject and object devices. The authors suggest that the current limited role of IoT in pre- and post-secondary classrooms is due to the lack of knowledge about this new technology; therefore, the focus of this paper is on the function of IoTs and the process of providing educators with the technology, instructional tools, and materials necessary to implement IoT devices within the classroom.", "authors": [{"name": "Mary Margaret Capraro", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Texas A&M University College Station,Texas,U.S.A\u00a0"}, {"name": "Hyunkyung Kwon", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Texas A&M University College Station,Texas,U.S.A\u00a0"}, {"name": "Aamir Fidai", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Texas A&M University College Station,Texas,U.S.A\u00a0"}, {"name": "Cynthia Jarvis", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Texas A&M University College Station,Texas,U.S.A\u00a0"}, {"name": "Gabrielle Buettner", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Texas A&M University College Station,Texas,U.S.A\u00a0"}, {"name": "Robert M.

Based on a qualitative survey with thirteen teachers, we developed a software prototype which allows teachers to create their own interactive worksheets consisting of texts, videos, quizzes, and practical programming exercises. Additionally, teachers can embed and further customize existing exercises from MOOCs. Further, we enable teachers to gain deeper insights by providing results from automated submission analysis, thus uncovering knowledge gaps and fostering content-driven in-class discussions. Our evaluation shows that the concept was well received by students and teachers alike: Teachers noticed the possibility of a shift in their role from a lecturing instructor to an individual tutor, as students are enabled to learn at their own pace and receive specific, direct feedback based on automated unit tests.

Over recent years, there has been a growth in the importance of working sustainability based on the SDGs. To identify which learning objective of each SDG corresponds to each learning outcome of the EDINSOST Sustainability Map, a correspondence matrix has been defined. The matrix contains the learning outcomes of the EDINSOST Sustainability Map in its rows, and the 17 SDGs in the columns. The cells of the matrix contain the learning objectives of the SDGs that correspond to each learning outcome of the EDINSOST Sustainability Map. This work in progress presents the first results of the process of mapping the SDGs into the EDINSOST Sustainability Map of Engineering Bachelor Degrees. Early results show that some of the 169 learning objectives are not applicable to Engineering Degrees. Likewise, we have seen that learning objectives have been defined more for policy makers than for engineers, and therefore adaptation is not an easy task.

In the present paper, we gauge the current state of ethics education and identify opportunities for improvement given current trends in teaching ethics in engineering. We find that engineering ethics education has a number of suboptimal characteristics. First, engineering ethics does not show clear links to varying ethical theories that might inform ethical reasoning and decision making. Second, engineering ethics education places a heavy emphasis on compliance or rule-following, which provides fewer opportunities for internalizing moral values and virtues. Third, ethics lessons often emphasize case studies of rare or extreme circumstances, like the NASA space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986, reinforcing the perception that morality is an infrequent professional concern. In the interest of improving ethics education, we introduce character education as a valuable approach to undergraduate engineering ethics education, one grounded in philosophical and psychological work on developing virtuous dispositions as well as personal, professional, and societal flourishing.

We found that 70% of students could solve problems involving a sequence of statements (i.e. without the use of selection or repetition) using a flowchart interpreter or Python.

The study examined senior exit interview survey data, provided by the Cal Poly Pomona Civil Engineering Department, to investigate the criteria that may influence a student's problem-solving capabilities regarding engineering problems. The data consisted of categorical responses to a wide variety of questions chosen by the Civil Engineering Department through rounds of discussion within the department assessment committee. Questions ranged from engineering club involvement, the confidence of capabilities in leadership and communication, and the ability to apply engineering knowledge. The survey was conducted on an anonymous basis utilizing the online tool, Survey Monkey. Past research investigating factors that influence a student's problem-solving capabilities have consisted of qualitative approaches, however, this research consists of a quantitative approach. The quantitative approach uses statistical modeling with the incorporation of senior survey data to identify the factors that influence a student's problem-solving capability. The statistical model implemented is a generalization of Principal Component Analysis, multiple correspondence analysis, which explains the association among several categorical variables. The reason for using multiple correspondence analysis over other statistical models is because of its ability to analyze data from a survey and determine associations between groups of individuals with similar backgrounds. This strongly fits the scope of this research as the model utilizes survey data collected on individuals with similar backgrounds. The key results after conducting the quantitative analysis are the influential factors that best describe a student's ability to solve engineering problems. By examining the commonalities and differences among student's that have problem-solving abilities at 3 different levels, average, good, and excellent, the variations in two different variables were distinguished as being responsible for explaining the difference in capability. The variables identified our ability to understand the impact of engineering solutions in multiple contexts and the ability to apply engineering techniques in practice. The difference in ability regarding these two variables explains the difference in problem-solving capabilities among the students as a group.

However, what is the classic MOOC clientele actually doing with their certificates? What are the reasons why successful MOOC learners put a lot of time and effort in exams and exercises? Do employers accept these certificates in application portfolios? Do they allow their employees to participate in a MOOC during their working hours? Do they pay for the certificates? Are there any differences concerning gender because women are still in the minority in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and their career paths often hit a plateau? These questions have been on our mind since we started offering courses on our MOOC platform in 2012. We have had anecdotal evidence, for example, that a participant was helped to get a new job with a certificate from one of our courses-yet this is ultimately just hearsay. Therefore, to find out what is really going on we conducted a survey among the 187,000 registered users of our platform.", "authors": [{"name": "Thomas Staubitz", "affiliation": "Hasso Plattner Institute,Internet Technologies and Systems,Potsdam,Germany\u00a0"}, {"name": "Christoph Meinel", "affiliation": "Hasso Plattner Institute,Internet Technologies and Systems,Potsdam,Germany"}, {"name": "Catrina John", "affiliation": "Hasso Plattner Institute,Internet Technologies and Systems,Potsdam,Germany\u00a0"}], "tags": ["europe", "engineering profession", "entrepreneurship", "internet", "qualifications", "stem"]}, {"title": "Debugging: The key to unlocking the mind of a novice programmer?", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028699", "abstract": "Novice programmers must master two skills to show lasting success: writing code and, when that fails, the ability to debug it.

Our main contribution is the identification of three categories and their respective subcategories for teaching programming: (i) characterization of contents, (ii) identification of pedagogical strategies and (iii) grouping of support tools. Context: Technology is increasingly more present in modern life. This demands qualified professionals in algorithmic thinking and coding. However, teaching programming is a challenging task, with frequently high dropout and failure rates. Because of this there is a large amount of scientific literature about methods and tools for teaching this topic. A systematic review to compile existing techniques can be very useful for teacher and professionals interested in the area. Objective: The goal of this paper is to identify and discuss the recent approaches used in teaching algorithms and data structures presented in the last five years of SIGCSE. Thus, we investigated the following research question: What are the recent approaches to teaching programming and data structures? Method: We conducted a review of the primary researches published in SIGCSE Technical Symposium during 2014-2018. All primary studies published in this period were evaluated according to the inclusion criteria. The studies related to our objective were completely read, passed through the extraction of data and classified according to the research questions. Results: In the end of the selection phase, 60 papers were used to conduct this research. Our results were classified into three categories: (i) contents were identified in 60 papers. We found that CS1 is predominant, it is present in 76.7% of papers. Whereas the teaching of CS2 is present in only 38.3% of the papers; (ii) teaching strategies were identified in 32 papers. Active learning approaches are usually the target of these studies. It should be noted that pair programming was present in 18.3% of these papers; finally (iii) 28 papers were found about support tools and most of them are focused on visualization and animation. Conclusion: Effective pedagogical approaches for teaching CS1 and CS2 are of great concern for educators around the globe. There is also a need for more tools that support the teaching of these disciplines.", "authors": [{"name": "Carlos N.

This study performs a novel collaborative art-based engineering project for 5th-8th grade students in Sacramento to introduce engineering design principles. Our goal in providing this workshop is to explore the following question: Does exposure to engineering design through a collaborative workshop which utilizes art and physical computing increase affinity toward engineering professional practice among 5th-8th graders in an under-served community? Physical computing projects encourage students to imagine, design, and build in the intersection of creative exploration and engineering. Such involvement with physical computing increases motivation and self-efficacy in primary school students. Utilizing familiar craft-based materials such as paper with coding and circuits can bridge the gap between the known world of arts and crafts and the unknown world of engineering-based design. Since students enroll into the workshop to create a collaborative digital art display versus enrolling into a strictly \u201ccoding\u201d workshop, their unfamiliar or intimidating feelings towards engineering may be alleviated. Developing self-efficacy in engineering activities can play a vital role in developing engineering affinity for youth. Likewise, the development of engineering affinity is a crucial first step toward developing engineering identity. During the summer workshop, students utilize arts and crafts with Arduino, sensors, LEDs, and servos. They are tasked with incorporating agile engineering principles to code, apply electronic fundamentals, and basic craft designs to create the final art display. Through this process, students develop a greater understanding of engineering design process. The cumulative resulting art installation is an immersive, interactive pixel light show display. We examine the students' development of self-efficacy and engineering affinity by surveying the students before and after the workshop. We perform analytics to see if their responses to the survey questions and prompts increase in using engineering terms and principles and how their confidence rating changes in various categories. We brainstorm how under-served students' interests can be captured, maintained and expanded to include engineering.

PolyPy bypasses these limitations by providing a flexible and easy-to-use framework that lets instructors define question templates. These templates contain segments that can exhibit one of many pre-set values; we refer to these segments as \u201crandomizable elements.\u201d The question instances are generated (from the templates) on-the-fly every time a student requests a new question via the student interface. To verify the correctness of students' answers, PolyPy interprets these question instances and compares their output to the students' submissions in real-time.

The module has migrated from a traditional delivery of lecture content through two-hour classroom lectures and one-hour tutorials to a blended learning platform with online activities before class and in-class activities. The introductory power systems course offered by the university covers a wide array of topics ranging from phasors, AC circuit analysis, power generation, transmission, and distribution. Online discussion forums were used to address the issues and queries that students had about the weekly sessions. It was found that, forum participation by students was minimal for previous iterations of the module and they preferred a face-to-face approach in solving their queries and doubts. To address this challenge and to close the feedback loop to the students for the weekly sessions, a live video revision session was incorporated into the module every Saturday. The live review sessions consisted of three parts. The first part includes a revision of the weekly content with clarifications on theoretical and numerical content. The second part of the live session is used to address and solve issues and queries received through the online discussion forum and emails. The final part of the revision session is a live doubt clearing session wherein students could ask their doubts live and they would be addressed in the revision session. The inclusion of this live review session will help in scaffolding the learner at the final stage of the weekly blended learning mode and will ensure that any lingering doubts and queries are addressed. Finally, the recorded video of the live session is uploaded to the learning platform for the students to view and review if necessary. This paper describes the incorporation of the live video session into the blended learning platform, student statistics and survey results on student experiences with these sessions.", "authors": [{"name": "Sangit Sasidhar", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore,Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Singapore"}], "tags": ["tools", "power systems", "tutorials", "numerical models", "discussion forums", "analytical models"]}, {"title": "Evaluating learners' emotional states by monitoring brain waves for comparing game-based learning approach to pen-and-paper", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9097262", "abstract": "A new interest in the use of game factors while acquiring new knowledge has emerged, and a number of researchers are investigating the effectiveness of the game-based approach in education systems. Recent research in game-based learning suggests that this approach imparts learning by involving learners in the learning process. The game factors generate affective-cognitive reactions that absorb users in playing the game and positively influence the learning. This paper offers a comparison of the learning processes between the game-based learning and pen-and-paper approaches. In this paper the analysis of both learning approaches is realized through a brain-controlled technology, using the Emotiv EEG Tech headset, by analyzing the stress, excitement, relaxation, focus, interest, and engagement that the learner is experiencing while going through both approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "Rabail Tahir", "affiliation": "Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, NTNU, Norway\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ali Shariq Imran", "affiliation": "Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, NTNU, Norway\u00a0"}, {"name": "Niraj Chaudhary", "affiliation": "Technology, Linneaus University, Vaxjo, Sweden"}, {"name": "Krenare Pireva", "affiliation": "Computer Science, UBT, Prishtina, Kosova\u00a0"}], "tags": ["electroencephalography", "stress", "electrodes", "headphones", "task analysis", "games", "problem-solving"]}, {"title": "Understanding Problems through Assignment Presentation: A Replication Study", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9097310", "abstract": "This study explores how a well-formed programming assignment can assist students in understanding a problem. To determine whether the presentation of a programming assignment might help CS1 students better understand the problem, we perform a comparable replication study using Soloway's Rainfall Problem. This study integrates scaffolding treatments from prior studies using the Rainfall Problem into a theoretical assignment design pattern, to form a new presentation context. A survey was used to gain insight into how students perceived the presentation helped them understand the problem and potentially helped them solve the programming tasks. Results from the study show plan composition and natural language translation a challenge, but students appreciate the additional guidance from the assignment presentation in the form of hints and bullet points formatting to identify tasks. From the results, we are considering these scaffolding treatments and assignment presentation for future CS1 programming assignments.", "authors": [{"name": "Katrina Falkner", "affiliation": "University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia"}, {"name": "Rebecca Vivian", "affiliation": "University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia\u00a0"}, {"name": "Rita Garcia", "affiliation": "University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia\u00a0"}], "tags": ["programming profession", "arrays", "computer languages", "task analysis", "time factors", "problem-solving"]}, {"title": "Enhancing Course Objectives for a Sophomore Electronic Devices Class via Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) Model and Attached Projects", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9097311", "abstract": "This Full Innovative Practice paper presents a new Peer-Led team Learning (PLTL) recitation model for the sophomore Electronics Analysis and Design course, emphasizing device physics, device models, and analog and digital applications in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at IUPUI. This new PLTL model with small number of students assigned to one peer-leader has enabled students to cooperate with each other and build teamwork, to get more practice with course software, and to better understand the course design component. This new model has overall improved the students' performance in the course. The new model has also enabled the instructor to introduce students to some research topics which led to students being encouraged to enroll in higher level related courses and to pursue further research in these areas. This paper details the structure of this new model, the feedback from students, the PLTL model recitation guidelines for the course semester, and attached projects. The paper also assesses the course objectives using this new model as compared to previous offerings.", "authors": [{"name": "Maher Rizkalla", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN"}, {"name": "Akul Madan", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ian Huelsman", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Taylor Peters", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ahmed Yago", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Zachary Cochran", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Raj Dhavalikar", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Grant Wible", "affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}, {"name": "Seemein Shayesteh", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN\u00a0"}], "tags": ["education", "computational modeling", "semiconductor diodes", "conferences", "analytical models", "integrated circuit modeling"]}]
