While non-terminating code is easier to diagnose interactively, it poses different concerns when software tests are being run auto-matically in batch. The common strategy of using a timeout to preemptively kill test runs that execute for too long has limita-tions, however. When one test case gets stuck in an infinite loop, forcible termination prevents any later test cases from running. Worse, when test results are buffered inside a test execution framework, forcible termination may prevent any information from being produced. Further, overly generous timeouts can de-lay the availability of results, and when tests are executed on a shared server, one non-terminating program can delay results for many people. This paper describes an alternative strategy that uses a fine-grained timeout on the execution of each individual test case in a test suite, and that adaptively adjusts this timeout dynamically based on the termination behavior of test cases com-pleted so far. By avoiding forcible termination of test runs, this approach allows all test cases an opportunity to run and produce results, even when infinite looping behaviors occur. Such fine-grained timeouts also result in faster completion of entire test runs when non-terminating code is present. Experimental results from applying this strategy to 4,214 student-written programs are dis-cussed, along with experiences from live deployment in the class-room where 8,926 non-termination events were detected over the course of one academic year.", "authors": [{"name": "Stephen H.

In this work we present an experiment in which we have requested teachers to compare different code solutions to the same problem. Then we have evaluated the level of agreement among each teacher comparison strategy and some algorithms generally used for plagiarism detection and automatic grading. We found out a maximum rate of 77% of agreement between one of the teachers and the algorithms, but a minimum agreement of 75%. However, for most of the teachers, the maximum agreement rate was over 90% for at least one of the automatic strategies to compare code. We have also detected that the level of agreement among teachers regarding their personal strategies to compare students solutions was between 62% and 95%, which shows that there may be more agreement between a teacher and an algorithm than between a teacher and one of her colleagues regarding their strategies to compare students' solutions.

This led to a series of room-packed sessions at the following six SIGCSE symposia to explore that idea from different angles. They have provided a forum for sharing: What we've done: Highlighting successful PBJA initiatives the presenters have undertaken or seen and wish to trumpet. What we should do (curriculum): Pointing out where our curriculum is lacking in PBJA, and how to fix it. How we should do it (pedagogy): Sharing how a change in attitude / focus / etc. can make strides to improving PBJA.\nWhile the initial PBJA sessions evolved from a need to understand and combat the enrollment crisis of eight years ago, we are now seeing an incredible resurgence in interest in our field, partially because --coders are hip and computer science is hot?. There are colleges where the numbers have exceeded historic highs, and some rightfully claim the crisis is over. This PBJA \"movement\" was born out of this enrollment crisis, but is not tied to it. There is always value in sharing novel best practices and advocating techniques that make computing fun for beginners.\nIn the past, we either tried to gather educators who brought a wide variety of perspectives, who would focus on a particular issue, or who have instituted very creative and successful paths into the major. This year we have gathered three seasoned educators who have taken the leap and built online classes for introductory computing on three different platforms. What innovative ideas did they employ to support collaboration? Does the need to auto-grade mean students can no longer choose their own final projects, and how does that stifle PBJA? Do these auto-graded formative assessments feel like drill-and-kill?

In the final stages of the project while one group of students worked on honing their own strategy, the other students implemented a pre-specified tie breaking mechanism used when two player strategies tie in a match.

Rather, it supports understanding and implementing the essential elements of lexical analysis, parsing, and semantics without having to wrestle with the complexities of dealing with \"industrial-strength\" compiler-compiler tools. Students quickly learn how to write PLCC \"grammar\" files for small languages that have straightforward syntax and semantics and use PLCC to build Java-based parsers, interpreters, or compilers for these languages that run out-of-the-box.\nInput to PLCC is a text file with a token definition section that defines language tokens as simple regular expressions, a syntax section that specifies the grammar rules of an LL(1) language as simple Backus-Naur Form (BNF) productions, and a semantics section that defines the language semantics as Java methods.\nPLCC generates a set of Java source files that are entirely self-contained and that import only standard elements of 'java.util' in JDK5 and above. For testing purposes, PLCC generates a read-eval-print loop that (1) reads standard input, (2) scans, parses, and evaluates the input, and (3) prints the evaluation to standard output.", "authors": [{"name": "Timothy Fossum", "affiliation": "SUNY College at Potsdam, Potsdam, NY, USA"}], "tags": ["compiler-compiler", "semantics", "interpreter", "syntax"]}, {"title": "Session details: Soft skills: academic perspectives", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3255039", "abstract": "No abstract available.", "authors": [{"name": "Briana Morrison", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology"}], "tags": []}, {"title": "Teaching and learning computer science soft skills using soft skills: the students' perspective", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2538862.2538885", "abstract": "This paper continues a previous paper [1] in which we described students' gradual understanding of computer science (CS) and software engineering (SE) soft skills. Our study focused on a course we taught on soft skills in CS and SE, offered by the Department of Computer Science at the Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology. The course was developed in response to a call by the Israeli hi-tech industry to equip Technion CS graduates with such skills. In [1] we presented the nature of CS soft skills, described the course schedule, including the teaching principles applied in the course, and showed how, in the course of the course, students gradually constructed a mental perception of CS soft skills in a 4-stage process. In this paper, we refine the comprehension process into a 6-rung ladder, based on further data analysis and additional experience gained when teaching the course for a second time. We elaborate on the additional rungs and further illuminate the results of two evaluation surveys on the course that were distributed to the students (in addition to the formal course evaluation administrated by the Technion's Center for the Promotion of Teaching). One of our main conclusions is that the course provides students with the opportunity to express their desire to be more involved in the teaching process of the course and to discuss and analyze their own soft skills. In other words, students realize the importance and significance of learning soft skills by actually implementing these skills in the learning process. In the Summary part of the paper, we present several pedagogical conclusions that are based on this observation and that we intend to implement in the future when teaching this course.", "authors": [{"name": "Orit Hazzan", "affiliation": "Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"}, {"name": "Gadi Har-Shai", "affiliation": "Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"}], "tags": ["soft skills", "managerial and cognitive aspects", "software engineering education", "social"]}, {"title": "Promoting ecoliteracy in an introductory database systems course: activities for the first week", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2538862.2538909", "abstract": "Promoting sustainability, critical thinking, and ethical awareness are goals that appear in the vision statements of the majority of universities in the United States nowadays.

In this paper, we report on our experiences developing an educational approach that we believe has contributed to the base of evidence that it is not only possible, but also desirable to do so. Our overriding goal has been to learn and exploit the extent to which mastering a complex graphics API like modern shader-based OpenGL can be enhanced by using a software design framework into which relevant concepts can be placed, thus facilitating more rapid assimilation and mastery of the concepts. We have been using this technique in our Introduction to Computer Graphics course in which we have two primary goals: teach shader-based OpenGL to students who have no prior experience using a graphics API, and present a framework to students that will scale up to medium and large scale applications, both in terms of code size as well as data size. We do not in any way suggest that our architecture is the 'best' for all advanced graphics applications, or even for teaching.

Whenever an impasse occurred while a student was trying to solve a problem, the observer would intervene by asking a sequence of questions with increasing specificity, ranging from strategic prompts to hints to provides, in order to determine the cause of the impasse. This study summarized the common difficulties for each of the Alice programming constructs used by the participants in the programming tasks, and students' difficulties were categorized into four types: connection, location, usage, and math-and-other difficulties. Students having connection difficulties were unable to apply appropriate programming constructs to implement the actions required; location difficulties indicated students? inability to locating, in the Alice interface, the programming constructs they needed; usage difficulties referred in general to semantic errors in a student's programs; whereas math-and-other difficulties were caused mainly by students' inadequate math knowledge.

We would like to discover factors that have an impact on student success in introductory programming in order to better advise and place our students into the course at the appropriate point in their academic careers. Our main motivation for increasing the CS1 pass rate is to help our students graduate on time. It has long been thought that mathematics background is a factor in determining a student's success in introductory computer science courses. Currently, our students must be concurrently enrolled in college algebra or placed into a higher mathematics course. However, given our current low pass rate, we wonder whether this is the proper prerequisite. In order to gather information about mathematics background, we administered a questionnaire to the students enrolled in the class during Spring 2013. We then analyzed the pass rate of our introductory programming students in relation to their mathematics background. Our findings indicate that students who are prepared to take calculus I in the same semester as they take introductory programming were more likely to pass introductory programming. These findings suggest that changing our math prerequisite to pre-calculus may increase the pass rate in our introductory programming course.", "authors": [{"name": "Christine F.

This persistent underrepresentation inhibits innovation by ignoring the diverse perspectives and life experiences women bring to invention and problem solving. Furthermore, disregard for girls and women's participation exacerbates existing economic disparities for women.

These instruments are usually unable to adequately assess change in interest, confidence and future plans for computing. In addition, sample sizes tend to be small and, because different programs use different surveys, results cannot be aggregated or compared across programs. To address this gap, NCWIT has been piloting a new evaluation instrument informed by Social Cognitive Career Theory (Lent et al., 2008). The instrument was piloted with two groups of girls: 312 Globaloria middle and high school students and 1500 girls who applied to NCWIT's Aspirations program from 2007 to 2013.

At what levels should these topics be taught in the curriculum? This is important as there is a growing demand in industry for User Experience specialists due to an increased focus on software quality and product success. A major complaint of employers is that this skill is lacking in many college graduates. Teaching computing students how to incorporate UX into the design and development process helps to address this critical need.

RealTimeWeb is a software architecture framework that makes real-time web data, such as weather reports, news updates, and restaurant recommendations, accessible for introductory programming projects. The presented technology offers technical scaffolding for the students to gradually ease into (or completely circumvent if appropriate) some of the most vexing complexities of distributed computing. At the heart of RealTimeWeb are carefully engineered client libraries through which students can access the data provided by real-time web services. To support computing educators teaching introductory CS classes in a variety of programming languages, each library is available in Python, Java, and Racket, with compatibility on key platforms, including Android. These libraries are readily available through an online curated gallery, designed to be quickly adapted to instructors' specific academic needs. This gallery also provides a tool for rapidly prototyping new libraries based on our framework. RealTimeWeb enables computing educators to introduce important real-time distributed computing concepts without overwhelming students with the low-level details that working with such data typically requires. This workshop introduces RealTimeWeb via a hands-on approach by introducing participants to the core functionality of our architectural framework and client libraries. The workshop proceeds in three parts in which we: (1) present RealTimeWeb by working through a case study of creating a programming project in a typical CS 2 course; (2) demonstrate how the framework can be used to rapidly prototype a new library of the participants' choice; and (2) critically discuss the technology in small and large groups.\nFurther information is at: http://research.cs.vt.edu/vtspaces/realtimeweb/", "authors": [{"name": "Clifford A.

POGIL is based on learning science, and shares characteristics with other forms of active, discovery, and inquiry learning. In a POGIL classroom, teams of 3-5 learners work on instructor-facilitated activities. Through scripted inquiry and investigation, learners discover concepts and construct their own knowledge. Using assigned team roles and meta-cognition, learners develop process skills and individual responsibility. Studies show that POGIL can significantly improve student performance. POGIL has particular potential for CS education. Software development is largely a team-based problem-solving activity, and POGIL helps students to learn from each other and develop problem-solving abilities as well as important team process skills.
