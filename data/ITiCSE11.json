There is growing consciousness which has led to various ideas and programs to deal with these problems. My talk will introduce a set of measures which we have implemented at RWTH Aachen University to tackle the problem on different levels. Therefore, I will present our successful program go4IT! of robotic courses for girls in 5th and 6th grade and some empirical results of how these influence their interest in STEM topics. Currently we are developing follow-up measures based on Android and GUI programming on smartphones. These measures cumulate into our newly founded Computer Science Junior Academy InfoSphere as out-of-school educational lab. There we offer a variety of learning modules which can last between two hours and a few days. Complete school classes can book InfoSphere modules or interested pupils of different ages can collaborate on self-organized projects. We have implemented various learning programs for multi-modal devices such as multi-touch tables and smartphones in order to introduce different topics of computer science. Our vision for these educational labs is the enhancement to different disciplines which bring together learners of all ages from K-12, students, researchers and professionals for lifelong learning and vocational training.", "authors": [{"name": "Ulrik Schroeder", "affiliation": "RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"}], "tags": ["k-12 outreach"]}, {"title": "Technology for teaching the rest of us", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1999747.1999750", "abstract": "The motivated student is easy to teach.

The idea that computers can now be used to aid assessment is appealing. While implementing automatic marking of multiple choice questions is trivial, most educators agree that such form of assessment provides only limited insight into students' knowledge. Due to this limitation, teachers prefer to use unstructured questions in assessments. These questions, however, are much more complicated to mark as the semantic meaning of a response is more important than any of the individual keywords. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has a remarkable ability to infer meaning from a text in this way. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of an automatic marking system based on LSA and designed to grade paragraph responses to exam questions. In addition to presenting the algorithm and the theoretical basis of the system, we describe the tests that were conducted to test its efficacy. The tests included comparing the marks for several computer science courses exams generated by the system with the original grades awarded by a human examiner. The various settings of the system are studied to understand their effect on the accuracy. Using this understanding, along with trial and error, good configurations for each question are found. Under ideal configurations the system is capable of generating marks with correlations above 0.80 compared to the human examiner's grades. This is considered an acceptable variance. Generating these ideal configurations is nontrivial but possible by designing effective ways to extract appropriate settings from features of the data. If there is enough training data the system easily performs at rates that match the inter-correlation between human markers.", "authors": [{"name": "Richard Klein", "affiliation": "University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa"}, {"name": "Mayya Tokman", "affiliation": "University of California Merced, Merced, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Angelo Kyrilov", "affiliation": "University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa"}], "tags": ["e-learning", "e-assessment", "automated grading", "latent semantic analysis", "automated assessment"]}, {"title": "WeScheme: the browser is your programming environment", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1999747.1999795", "abstract": "We present a programming environment called WeScheme that runs in the Web browser and supports interactive development.

We had four goals: increased learning, enthusiasm about CS, confidence in technical ability and communication skills. To achieve these goals, we decided to rely solely on the integration of teaching techniques that we believed would be highly effective: collaborative teams, student presentations, student critique of work, open-ended projects of student design, iterative process, journal re-ection, and motivation through helping others. The students had to learn about each technique through discussion, modeling, and moderated practice. We focused on this process learning and trusted that the technical material would come from solving the (unspecified) assignments. This focus left no time for traditional teaching activities.
