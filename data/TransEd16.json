The participants in the experiments were 76 students enrolled in three courses on project management for software development at the University of Murcia, Spain, and the Mohammed V University of Rabat, Morocco. The results of a fixed effects meta-analysis (Hedges' g) obtained a medium effect ( -0.495, p=0.034) for productivity, and a large effect ( -1.077, ) for effectiveness, in favor of using a catalog-based reuse process rather than a conventional specification process. The other co-factor examined, distribution (either global or co-located), had no statistically significant interaction with the process used (catalog-based reuse or conventional specification) for either effectiveness or productivity. Further research is required to study the effectiveness and productivity of the catalog-based requirements engineering learning method so that it can be taught in software engineering courses and applied in real software engineering projects.", "authors": [{"name": "Jos\u00e9 Luis Fern\u00e1ndez-Alem\u00e1n", "affiliation": "Department of Informatics and Systems, University of Murcia, Spain"}, {"name": "Ambrosio Toval", "affiliation": "Department of Informatics and Systems, University of Murcia, Spain"}, {"name": "Joaqu\u00edn Vidal Meca", "affiliation": "Department of Informatics and Systems, University of Murcia, Spain"}, {"name": "Juan Manuel Carrillo-de-Gea", "affiliation": "Department of Informatics and Systems, University of Murcia, Spain"}, {"name": "Joaqu\u00edn Nicol\u00e1s Ros", "affiliation": "Department of Informatics and Systems, University of Murcia, Spain"}, {"name": "Ali Idri", "affiliation": "Software Project Management research team, ENSIAS, University Mohammed V, Rabat, Morocco"}], "tags": ["requirements reuse", "distributed software development environments", "cataloguing", "student experiments", "Catalogs", "Cultural differences", "Mohammed V University of Rabat, Morocco", "requirements specification", "requirements engineering learning method", "project management", "ISO standards", "computer science education", "Productivity", "global software development", "software project management course", "formal verification", "University of Murcia Spain", "requirements catalogs", "Software", "Electronic learning", "educational courses", "software engineering courses", "computer aided instruction", "Project management"]}, {"title": "More Time or Better Tools?

The multiple-choice question format, offering a choice between a correct selection and common misconceptions, can provide an assessment of students' conceptual understanding in various dimensions. Misconceptions of some engineering concepts exist due to a lack of mental frameworks, or schemas, for these types of concepts or conceptual areas. This study incorporated an open textual response component in a multiple-choice concept inventory test to capture written explanations of students' selections. The study's goal was to identify, through text analysis of student responses, the types and categorizations of concepts in these explanations that had not been uncovered by the distractor selections. The analysis of the textual explanations of a subset of the discrete-time signals and systems concept inventory questions revealed that students have difficulty conceptually explaining several dimensions of signal processing. This contributed to their inability to provide a clear explanation of the underlying concepts, such as mathematical concepts. The methods used in this study evaluate students' understanding of signals and systems concepts through their ability to express understanding in written text.

Students' eye movements during debugging were recorded by an eye tracker to investigate whether and how high- and low-performance students act differently during debugging. Thirty-eight computer science undergraduates were asked to debug two C programs. The path of students' gaze while following program codes was subjected to sequential analysis to reveal significant sequences of areas examined. These significant gaze path sequences were then compared to those of students with different debugging performances. The results show that, when debugging, high-performance students traced programs in a more logical manner, whereas low-performance students tended to stick to a line-by-line sequence and were unable to quickly derive the program's higher-level logic. Low-performance students also often jumped directly to certain suspected statements to find bugs, without following the program's logic. They also often needed to trace back to prior statements to recall information, and spent more time on manual computation.

Students pitched their ideas to the industry guests at a virtual \u201ctrade fair\u201d held within a hybrid video conferencing and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environment, in preparation for the assessable pitches that they had to deliver on campus to a faculty audience. Survey and assessment results attest to the participants' satisfaction as well as to the effectiveness of the approach in improving student self-efficacy and performance. The paper concludes with recommendations for engineering educators looking to implement similar initiatives and a brief outline of the authors' plans for the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Peter J.

The paper reviews the laboratory activities developed for the PSP course at Curtin University, Australia; these methods are applicable and can be used for PSP course instruction at any institution. These activities were developed to improve the learning experience of the electrical engineering undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in this course. Initially, the PSP course at Curtin University consisted of lectures and tutorials accompanied by two sessions of software-based simulations and one session of laboratory demonstration. To motivate the students, several computer-based simulations and practical laboratory experiments were developed. PSCAD and ETAP power system analysis software tools are introduced and used to demonstrate the performance and coordination of different protection relays from steady-state and dynamic points of view. Also, a practical setup composed of a LabVolt power system simulator and industrial relays is used to carry out several practical experiments. The experiments help students observe the performance of protection systems for transformers and induction motors during faults and abnormal operating conditions. Finally, the concept of relay testing and commissioning is introduced by relay standalone experiments using a secondary injection relay test set. The results of these activities were evaluated according to the students' satisfaction, comments, total scores, and interest in PSP.", "authors": [{"name": "Hadi Hosseinian Yengejeh", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"}, {"name": "Farhad Shahnia", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"}, {"name": "Moayed Moghbel", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"}], "tags": ["relay protection", "practical activities", "PSP course instruction", "transformer protection", "laboratory activities", "learning experience improvement", "Computational modeling", "secondary injection relay test set", "LabVolt power system simulator", "power system CAD", "transformers", "electrical engineering postgraduate students", "software-based simulations", "student satisfaction", "Circuit breakers", "Relays", "computer-based simulations", "student motivation", "computer-based activities", "power system protection course student motivation", "Education", "Curtin University", "power engineering education", "induction motors", "software tools", "PSCAD", "PSCAD power system analysis software tool", "electrical engineering undergraduate students", "power system protection", "Circuit faults", "power system simulation", "educational courses", "ETAP power system analysis software tool", "computer aided instruction", "industrial relays", "Australia"]}, {"title": "Student and Staff Perceptions of Key Aspects of Computer Science Engineering Capstone Projects", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7106575/", "abstract": "In carrying out their capstone projects, students use knowledge and skills acquired throughout their degree program to create a product or provide a technical service.

This study compares student and staff perceptions of key aspects of completing this type of project, such as project characteristics, student competencies, advisor involvement, and student perceived learning. The primary finding of this study is that the students' expectations differ greatly from those of staff. In particular, students tend to have a better opinion of their project, their competencies, and the supervision received than does the staff. However, advisors and evaluation committees have a similar opinion about projects characteristics. The students' perception of their learning, furthermore, is not always consistent with the grade obtained or student satisfaction.

In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment. The course had students build a modular management system for home appliances, implementing control software on the \u201cArduino\u201d open-source platform, as well as using wireless communications. The results show that teaching, learning, and student assessment processes can be improved by using PBL with CL.

This paper addresses the challenge of teaching robotics to undergraduate engineering students, through an experiential learning project of robotics fundamentals based on a case study of robot-assisted stereotactic neurosurgery. The project was integrated into the curriculum of a Biomedical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering program, but can also be integrated in related courses. First, students are given a presentation on the planning and execution of a stereotactic neurosurgery procedure, with special attention being paid to the concepts involved, namely spatial transformations, kinematics, and trajectory planning. Students are then taught to use a robotics simulation tool for robot-assisted stereotactic neurosurgery. They are shown how this can be used as a specialized control application, providing direct feedback on the robot's motion in a neurosurgery scenario. They are then required to select a robotic manipulator, and to develop and implement its control code to make it perform as a robot assistant in this surgical procedure. Project efficacy was evaluated through student self-report data (with dedicated anonymous surveys) and through the impact on academic and pedagogical results (by means of statistical inference). The results of the student surveys show that the robotics simulator for stereotactic neurosurgery is well suited to its role as an experiential learning tool since it enhances the understanding and application of several robotics concepts in an appealing manner. The positive impact of the project learning experience is supported by a comparison to earlier years of student grades, pass rates, and feedback from an institutional survey.", "authors": [{"name": "S\u00e9rgio Monteiro", "affiliation": "Department of Industrial Electronics and Centre Algorithm, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal"}, {"name": "Estela Bicho", "affiliation": "Department of Industrial Electronics and Centre Algorithm, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal"}, {"name": "Wolfram Erlhagen", "affiliation": "Department of Mathematics and Applications, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal"}, {"name": "Toni Machado", "affiliation": "Department of Industrial Electronics and Centre Algorithm, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal"}, {"name": "Manuel Rito", "affiliation": "Neurosurgery Service, Coimbra University Hospital Centre, Coimbra, Portugal"}, {"name": "Carlos Faria", "affiliation": "Department of Industrial Electronics and Centre Algorithm, University of Minho, Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal"}, {"name": "Carolina Vale", "affiliation": "Department of Physics, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal"}], "tags": ["Trajectory", "biomedical engineering program", "undergraduate engineering students", "path planning", "electrical engineering program", "computer engineering program", "Joints", "project learning experience", "medical robotics", "trajectory planning", "robotics fundamentals", "biomedical education", "further education", "experiential learning project", "Neurosurgery", "surgery", "robotics simulation tool", "experiential learning", "robot kinematics", "surgical procedure", "robotics simulator", "robotic manipulators", "robot motion", "robotics teaching", "robot-assisted stereotactic neurosurgery", "manipulators", "Educational robots", "spatial transformations", "neurosurgery", "Robot kinematics", "direct feedback", "Experiential learning", "educational courses", "robotic manipulator", "statistical inference", "statistical analysis", "teaching"]}, {"title": "Measuring the Impact of Agile Coaching on Students\u2019 Performance", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7372484/", "abstract": "Nowadays, considerable attention is paid to agile methods as a means to improve management of software development processes. The widespread use of such methods in professional contexts has encouraged their integration into software engineering training and undergraduate courses. Although several research efforts have focused on teaching Scrum through simulating a software development project, they covered only the learning of programming practices within a Scrum team. Furthermore, few studies tackle nontechnical skills other than the development practices themselves. The work presented here introduces an original Scrum-based training model enhanced with agile coaching to maximize student performance. This was validated by a case study on a capstone project in a Scrum course. This paper summarizes the positive results of introducing agile coaching, which resulted in approximately 22% more coverage of software engineering practices.
