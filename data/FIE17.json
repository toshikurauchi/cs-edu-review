This has led to an increased demand for engineers and data scientists. However, courses imparting crucial ideas from data design, administration and maintenance to data analytics and knowledge discovery remain under-subscribed due to perceived difficulty, low interest and motivation. This motivation can be represented by three constructs: interest in the topic, personal control and difficulty of the exercise. Role-playing games (RPGs) have been proven to stimulate students interest in analysis and problem solving when faced with varying tasks. This paper investigates the integration of specific game-based elements and pop-culture references into course delivery and assessment to boost interest and learner motivation in an elective postgraduate database systems course at The University of the West Indies. The experimental setup for assessment of students' progress in this course uses an experience point (XP) level-based system adapted from popular RPGs. To further stimulate interest, pop-culture references to specific animated series' and fantasy game genres are used. A student can choose to take one of multiple paths for their learning, representing different tools/platforms that can be used in implementation and analysis. Students can attempt more than one path for more experience and higher levels, although it is not expected. Completion of each path indicates formative \u201cmastery\u201d of the selected data science tool/platform. Summative assessments uses a \u201craid-party system\u201d where students who have been encouraged along different paths are now asked to join together to 1. analyse given datasets and capture their findings in the format of an academic paper, and 2. build a complete database application for a particular scenario. Formative feedback is done in groups to leverage scaffolding. Measurement of the students' activity and interest is done using automatically generated activity logs from the online delivery course system as well as administration of an online electronic questionnaire. Both of these instruments are used to determine how effective this approach is in influencing students' interest and motivation.

Despite broad consensus on the vital function of communication- and social skills, they tend to be underrepresented in the training of software-engineers and project managers. This is partly because such skills are less explicit than technical methods, tools, and artefacts. To address this deficiency, an openly accessible web-based communication model for multicultural teams (comMCT) was developed. It consists of four modules addressing structural, functional, organizational, and interpersonal/behavioral aspects of multicultural communication.

The results indicate that there is a significant difference between the minority and non-minority students' progress in their assignment and exam grades throughout the semester. It is also revealed that minority students' performance had a rapid change and considerable improvement towards the end of the semester.

According to the Self-determination Theory (SDT) there is a relation between the context, the motivation, and the performance of individuals in a given task. Thus, a continuum is defined between intrinsic, extrinsic, and lack of motivation; so individuals intrinsically motivated would perform optimally. In order to adequate the communication module of the system Sapiens for the learning of efficient energy consumption, this work has proposed to develop an instrument to evaluate the level of situational motivation of individuals, and to design persuasive messages to increase the engagement on the task, based on the motivation profiles described by SDT. For this, a methodology was defined comprising the following stages: (i) bibliographic research of the state-of-art scales to assess motivation; (ii) design of a data collection instrument in the form of a structured questionnaire; (iii) evaluation of the instrument considering an heterogeneous sample of 589 college, high-school, technical, master, and doctoral students, aged between 14 and 80 years, at three different situations (the library, the classroom, and leisure); (iv) design of the persuasive messages to enhance the user engagement on the task. The resulting instrument was named Ubiquitous Situational Motivation Scale (USMS), consisted in 18 questions presented as a 7-points Likert Scale, that measures four motivational factors with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0.61 to 0.86. Our study revealed that subjects' motivation profile varied according to the context, so leisure activities were respectively more related to intrinsic motivation than the library and the classroom activities, and suggests that classroom activities are probably more related to external regulation. The results were also consistent with the continuum hypothesis of SDT. The evaluation with potential users showed that the persuasive messages designed based on the motivational profiles were positively rated. From these results the persuasive module will integrated to the Sapiens platform so the performance of the users can be studied.", "authors": [{"name": "Fernando Pereira de Toledo", "affiliation": "Centro de Ciencias Computacionais, Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG), Av.

The step of reflection within the social constructivist pedagogy has a crucial role in building the learner's mental model and in refining the existing mental model. This paper presents a novel research case study on the employment of an innovative process of student reflection and analysis. This innovative process promotes a unique, non-traditional approach of employing a social interaction based dialogue of inquiry that helps engage each learner in a self-reflective assessment prior to the action learning. The process is in line with the social constructivist model that is based upon inquiry based knowledge building. It helps students debug their conceptual understandings, which make up their respective cognitive models. It also enables them to identify problems or limitations within that mental model before the actual knowledge assimilation or accommodation takes place. The presented case study strives to address a key issue of the social constructivist model i.e. how to ensure that students successfully self-reflect upon what they are learning. In order to so, this research performs a comparative analysis between the results obtained through the presented social constructivist self-reflection assessment and the outcomes of a software based traditional assessment.

Central to the analysis in this paper is how the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) can provide explanations for the incident. The critical incident can be summarised as students refusing to take part in a non-compulsory, but from the faculty perspective highly educational, activity. We describe the incident in depth, give the background for the educational intervention, and analyse the incident from the perspective of TPB. This paper makes two major contributions to engineering education research. The first is the development of a method for analysing critical teaching and learning incidents using the TPB. The critical incident analysis illustrates how the method is used to analyse and reason about the students' behaviour. Another contribution is the development of a range of insights which deal with challenges raised by learning interventions, especially those involved with acquiring hidden or \u201cinvisible skills\u201d not usually seen or acknowledged by students to belong to core subject area of a degree program.", "authors": [{"name": "Asa Cajander", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Mats Daniels", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Aletta Nylen", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Roger McDermott", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Digital Media, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK"}, {"name": "Arnold Pears", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Anne-Kathrin Peters", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jonas Moll", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Diane Golay", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}], "tags": ["human computer interaction", "software", "computer science", "predictive models", "electronic mail", "education", "attitude control"]}, {"title": "Understanding the relationships between self-regulated learning and students source code in a computer programming course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2017.8190467", "abstract": "To increase the success in computer programming courses, it is important to understand the learning process and common difficulties faced by students. Although several studies have investigated possible relationships between students performance and self-regulated learning characteristics in computer programming courses, little attention has been given to the source code produced by students in this regard. Such source code might contain valuable information about their learning process, specially in a context where practical programming assignments are frequent and students should write source code constantly during the course. This paper presents a strategy to support the correlation analysis among students performance, motivation, use of learning strategies, and source code metrics in computer programming courses. A comprehensive case study is presented to evaluate the proposed strategy through collected data (self-regulated learning characteristics and source code) from 205 undergrad students that accepted to participate voluntarily in the study during three semesters. Results show that the main features from source code which are significantly related to students performance and self-regulated learning features are: length-related metrics, with mainly positive correlations; and Halstead complexity measures, correlated negatively.", "authors": [{"name": "Fabio A.

However, there is a lack of qualified professionals in this area. This can be caused due to difficulty in teaching software testing through approaches that use only theoretical classes and traditional tools. In addition, there is a lack of motivation due to the work environment and the strategies of allocation and responsibility of these professionals in development and testing teams. To mitigate these problems, approaches have been used to support software testing education, such as: educational games, integrated teaching of software testing with programming, educational modules, among others. The objective of this paper was to develop an educational game named Testing Game, addressing the following topics: functional testing, structural testing and mutation testing. To support the development of the Testing Game, we performed a systematic mapping aiming at selecting a game engine. To evaluate the efficiency of the game, we conducted a feasibility study to evaluate the quality regarding motivation, user experience and learning from the point of view of the students. We also evaluate the usability of the Testing Game. Approximately 85.64% of people who participated in the study assessed the quality of the game in a positive perspective regarding motivation, user experience and learning from the point of view of the students. Regarding the usability of the game, students identified minor problems.

Visuohaptic simulations are computer-based simulations that encode mathematical and physical models of certain phenomena and provide visual and tactile feedback. Users can see the simulation and feel the friction with their hand by using a special device connected to a computer. We hypothesized that visual and haptic feedback together can help students to improve learning of friction. We recruited 24 engineering technology students with a previous experience in at least one physics course, and we examined their reasoning and understanding about statics concepts before and after engaging with visuo-haptic simulations. Our instructional approach included four steps: 1) lecture about friction, 2) pretest, 3) laboratory session, and 4) posttest. The laboratory session consisted of a pre-training session, guided learning materials based on a constructivist framework, and use of the friction visuo-haptic simulation. We report students' prior conceptions of statics concepts, ways in which they interacted and reasoned with each of the different pedagogical tools, and compared reasoning processes, explanations and learning gains.

During implementation, problems such as: bandwidth, security or limitations in terms of the usability, have been identified. This paper proposes an approach that integrates, what we call, a Smart Adaptive Remote Laboratory (SARL) with Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) to improve the students' experience by automatically adapting the experiments according to the student's current level of knowledge and experience. For this purpose, the laboratory experiment is connected with the VLE to access the student profile and academic information. This information is used by the SARL to adapt the educational content and the experimental interfaces accordingly. All students access the same set of equipment, but the adaptive system shows a variation of the graphic user interface with different controls and activities. The VLE provides the assessment component, completing the learning experience. The results of the experiments are stored in the remote laboratory system and sent back to the VLE to update the student information. A Raspberry Pi microcontroller and a web camera are used as hardware of the remote interface. The prototype software platform was implemented using Python and JavaScript languages and HTML 5 interface.

While the authors found some students progress onto graduate school, nearly 60% were enrolled in the 3/2 programs. These are programs where students complete a bachelor and master degree in 5 years. Our study also showed students, primarily those that are a minority by race or gender, do not continue their education through graduate school. These findings raise some questions about these students and what steps will encourage their persistence or return to graduate study. Therefore, further examination of available data, future interviews with current students and graduates will provide a better understanding of the lack of diversification and persistence in technology graduate programs. Utilization of data gathered in the large institutional database provides a means to understand how the perception of students influences their decision to persist, continue, and complete further study. Increased understanding as it relates to students decisions to persist allows institutions to develop strategies to change student perceptions and decisions to persist.

The study was conducted in a discipline offered in a higher education institution. Four SNA metrics were used in the results. These metrics include: density, degree centrality, the relative centrality and global centrality. Through these metrics it became possible to measure the relationships between students and find out, for example, which students needed more attention from the teacher. In addition, it was possible to identify students who interact more and students who are relationship bridges on the network, among other information. Thus, the results showed that SNA helped the teacher in the understanding of the interaction structure between students.", "authors": [{"name": "Jose Francisco de M.

We then use ANOVA to detect whether such difference also presented in the same type of questions. We found that there is no significant difference across questions of the same difficulty level.

Mathematics is particularly challenging for those who have been successful in high school without needing to study. Engineering mathematics college courses tend to cover twice the volume of material in 60% of the class time of high school mathematics courses. Thus, the need for outside study time is increased drastically, and the time to absorb and practice concepts and skills is reduced. Surveys from students in a summer precalculus program revealed that they understood that their strategies for success in mathematics should change as they transitioned to college. However, they often failed to begin the change while participating in the summer program designed to increase their algebra and precalculus skills in preparation for engineering calculus. The research questions for this study are: 1) For prospective engineering students in a summer precalculus bridge program, how did their expectations of college mathematics study compare with their expectations of high school mathematics study? 2) How well do prospective engineering students in a summer precalculus bridge program begin to change their study habits in preparation for engineering college mathematics?", "authors": [{"name": "Jim Morgan", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Department of Engineering, Charles Sturt University, Bathurst, NSW, Australia"}, {"name": "Ali Bicer", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM Department of Teaching, Learning and Culture, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas\u00a0"}, {"name": "Sandra B.

New undergraduate students are aware that they will need mathematical concepts in professional activities. It is still usual to observe not only the difficulty of students in mathematical disciplines, but also the lack of motivation for those disciplines. Motivate and keep motivated the engineering students to mathematical disciplines are a challenge for the teacher. In the literature, it is possible to observe the use of modeling tools of mathematical problems, some of them able to simulate models. Those tools have been used to try to motivate students, but with a technological bias that may introduce difficulties. In this paper we propose an approach to teaching-learning process of mathematical concepts to engineering students with a motivational factor: a practical problem to be modeled in which students must apply concepts seen in class, in particular using the Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). Each student can choose a problem of his/her interest, which increases motivation. The problem chosen must be explored to create mathematical models involving multiple concepts, which allows the comparison of results. Students must create models using existing computational tools, preferably of free use, supported by instructor. So, the students are allowed to apply the concepts acquired to develop projects with transversal themes aiming to verify the capability and the use of these tools in learning mathematical concepts. Also, this paper presents an application of the approach proposed in Numerical Methods for Differential Equations course. We observed that the use of computer tool to model a real problem chosen by students has improved the interest and, consequently, facilitated the teaching-learning process. Also, it may develop in students a new vision on how they can build their knowledge.

These circumstances pose a more challenging situation in terms of encouraging beginners to become interested in this subject during an introductory course. In this study, we were motivated to study interest for learning coding in naturalistic contexts and from a dynamic point of view. To investigate it in this fashion, the Four-Phase Model of Interest Development was used. Based on an in-depth and a qualitative design, two groups of Brazilian beginners were observed. In this paper, we present how their interests have unfolded and why changes happened. Contextual factors, such as level of structure around the teaching process and tasks, and the educator's attitudes, emerged as positive influences. By understanding why beginners felt interested in engaging with coding, the role of some human factors in these learning experiences came up. Some students were not skilled at self-regulating. Also, when their beliefs of being able to learn coding dropped, willingness to engage was negatively affected. This study brings a non-fragmented view of the process of interest development in learning coding and its complexity. The findings highlight a need for educators to become more informed about how this process takes place and what individual characteristics are involved with it.

Gamification is the application of game elements and game principles in non-game contexts. We propose a process to identify profiles in gamification through the use of ludic activities and gamification driven questionnaires. The choice of activities follows some information of the target audience, such as: age range, cell phone use, internet access and other data. The use of questionnaires is necessary to cross-check the activity data, analyze data and identify the resulting gamification profile. The proposed methodology consists of six steps process: making a baseline, defining core drivers, defining activities, preparing a questionnaire, planning data collection, and analyzing data. The purpose of the process is to identify which gamification core drivers (the motivations) may be most effective in attracting students' attention. Gamification is a powerful tool to attract students. Also, a good gamification rise their interest up to learn and caught attention for a long period of time. A good gamification educational project will produce a very attractive educational game. The resulting game will motivate students to do something different: to study in a new way. We used Yu Kai-Chou's Octalysis framework to identify and model the student profile. The final gamification project is also an Octalysis model. The Octalysis framework is based on basic human motivations according to eight core drivers, which are: Epic Meaning & Calling, Development & Accomplishment, Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback, Ownership & Possession, Social Influence & Relatedness, Scarcity & Impatience, Unpredictability & Curiosity and Loss & Avoidance. Finally, in order to test and evaluate the methodology, we applied the whole process on four classes of two different public schools. The 98 students are from different ages and different grades (7th to 10th grades). The results indicate the process is useful to identify the students' gamification profile, the activities and the questionnaires provide a good data set to identify the core drivers and the resulting gamification project clearly depicts the final profile.", "authors": [{"name": "Arthur R.

In the fall of 2015, an innovative design project was used in a first-year engineering course at Michigan Technological University. Students were given the task to develop a prototype of a new product or an improvement on an existing product. While some of the tasks were defined throughout the semester, the product they created was completely up to the team.

In our own long experience of using open-ended problems in collaborative student projects, we have identified a lack of systematic progression in learning outcomes and skill development. We see this as a major obstacle for fully exploiting the potentials of using open-ended problems as an educational tool. We present a framework that provides a structured view of challenges related to openness that students can encounter in educational projects and that has an impact on the overall complexity of the project. We argue that there are different categories of openness to consider when designing educational settings based on open-ended projects.

In this environment that passes common critical mass thresholds, we observed gendered responses that call into question the use of simple percentages as proxies for inclusiveness in engineering. Specifically, we found that women and men held some common values, and similarly endorsed certain identity traits such as problem solving and practicality. Compared to men, however, women reported lower self-efficacy, lower endorsement of technological leadership, higher emphasis on social consciousness, and less freedom to express their ideas and opinions.

One such innovation is Purdue University's Freeform environment for teaching undergraduate engineering courses. Freeform aims to enhance student learning with an Active, Blended, and Collaborative (ABC) learning environment. The majority of research into the Freeform environment thus far has focused on student outcomes and the tools Freeform uses rather than instructional practice [1-3]. However, with the growth of Freeform and other ABC environments, the lack of actionable feedback available to instructors about their role and practices is becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, with the goal of building on the characterization of Freeform and ABC pedagogies in general, this paper presents a one-semester longitudinal analysis of two instructors and comparisons of their actions in this environment. The study concludes that these two instructors retain individuality in their pedagogical choices and adapt their instruction to the material presented while staying within the Freeform ABC ethos throughout the semester.", "authors": [{"name": "E.

For this purpose, a rubric is developed to classify questions based on cognitive domains of Bloom's Taxonomy. We applied the developed rubric to evaluate three semester tests and design a final exam. In designing the final test, we aim to challenge students' skills in a predetermined proportion and combination that maps onto the levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

A class of twenty-two students in a 200-level undergraduate Digital Electronics course that was offered at West Virginia University were asked to conduct several of their assigned homework problems using a Lightboard, a lecture recording tool that allows the user to face the camera while writing on a transparent surface. The intent of these exercises was to gain a better understanding of the students' thought process and see the effect on their self-confidence in circuit solving skills. While conducting the assignments, students would narrate how they were solving the circuit problem on the Lightboard, as if they were teaching the problem to their peers. These recorded sessions were assessed for problem-solving skills using a rubric with the following performance indicators: defining the problem, determining the strategy and procedure, evaluating the outcomes, creating diagrams and sketches, using neatness and organization, and referencing terminology and notation. Students were also asked to complete a survey prior to and after the Lightboard sessions using a five-point Likert scale to gauge their self-confidence.

In an earlier work, authors developed a hands-on lab to help students learn how an ARP spoofing attack works by asking them to create and send attack packets. To enhance learning further, we present an interactive visualization tool that intuitively shows the effects of the ARP spoofing attack in real-time. The Hacker Graphical User Interface (HGUI) is an interactive visualization tool developed to assist students in learning how ARP Spoofing works. By modeling a controlled ARP Spoofing attack using virtual machines, we give students the ability to alter elements of the attack by interacting with the visualization. This tool was developed using Processing, an open source programming language used in many visual art communities. It runs on virtual machines installed with Kali Linux. This tool animates attack packets, normal packets, and the status of ARP cache in real-time. If students have successfully carried out the ARP spoofing attack, they can see the normal packets being routed to the attacker machine and the victim's ARP cache being poisoned. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the lab. Tests were conducted to measure the performance of students before and after using this tool.

In this context, the classes' evaluation by students has been a tool widely used in various universities in different countries. For institutions and teachers, these assessments allow knowing and measuring the results, further analysis of the institutional status, reviewing projects, adjusting goals, diagnosing weaknesses and correcting possible deviations. For the monitoring and improvement of this process, it was necessary to create instruments that aimed to evaluate the performance of the proposed changes. The teaching-learning methodology adopted in the Introduction to Computer Science classes may be a process that makes it difficult to understand the principles of language programming for undergraduate students in Computer Science and related areas, generating high failure and course drop out rates. This paper presents an analysis of the results obtained in the Introduction to Computer Science classes taught in five Engineering courses, of the Faculty of Gama (FGA) at University of Brasi\u0301lia (UnB).

In this way, the teaching of both subjects, programming and testing, becomes an integrated teaching approach. Testing practices in this context can provide a timely feedback to students while they are still working on programming assignments and, as a result, increase the quality of their code. Besides, developing students' testing skills earlier is useful to improve their programming skills as well, since both kinds of skills are complementary. However, this integration is not straightforward, because lecture hours and the coverage of programming topics must remain the same, while testing concepts and practices are introduced. For this reason, when designing an educational approach to introduce testing practices to novice programmers, there is also the need to address potential difficulties faced by both students and instructors. Considering this scenario, this paper aims at identifying the challenges raised due to the integration of software testing into introductory programming courses. The goal is to provide support for instructors who intend to adopt the integrated approach. The challenges have been identified from the results of a systematic mapping we conducted of the literature in this domain. The main contribution of this paper refers to the establishment of a catalog of challenges faced to integrate software testing into introductory programming courses. We also discuss possible solutions to design courses using the integrated approach and point out challenges that have been scarcely addressed in the literature.

The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java.

The benefits of co-ops have been explored thoroughly in relation to both students and employers, as well as universities seeking to establish more connections with industry. Participants in co-ops often have higher starting salaries and a higher level of job satisfaction, because they have experienced the work and have accurate expectations for full-time employment. Employers also benefit from the co-op system, with both inexpensive labor and the opportunity to invest in qualified new employees. In addition to the career benefits and job satisfaction resulting from co-ops, participants in co-ops often reflect higher GPAs than their non-participant peers. However, in a study examining the transition from co-ops to full-time employment, though it was not specifically asked of them, thirty percent of students reported that the transition from their co-op back to their university hindered their academic motivation. The researchers also found similar experiences reported by students at another university and thought this consideration was worthy of further investigation. This study interviewed four students' experiences about the transition from their co-op experience to their full time enrollment at their university and how this transition impacted them. Students enrolled in engineering degree programs at University of Louisville are required to complete three co-ops before graduation. This lends to a unique situation where all students go on co-op, hence the interest in how co-ops affect the transition back to the university after co-op. The interviews lasted between 15\u201330 minutes in a structured format. The students volunteered from a survey asking about difficulties coming back to the university from co-op.

To address the first research question, a systematic mapping is performed to outline the current landscape. The second research question is answered by analyzing and reflecting on practical experiences acquired during the design of a MOOC on Agile Software Development. The design of the course was based on the Pedagogical Design Pattern Framework for MOOCs, an approach to design for learning that was defined in our previous studies. For this course, two environments were considered: (a) course-time on the Tim Tec MOOC platform for deeper engagement with active learning activities, such as Project-based learning; (b) a Facebook group as a social and collaborative learning space, including scenarios based on problem-based learning to activate prior knowledge. Some of the pedagogical strategies adopted to motivate self-regulated learning included self-introduction video, diary, diagnostic self-assessments, development of small projects alone and in pairs.

In order to inform this component of a contextual evaluation framework of MOOCs, this study seeks to answer the question, \u201cWhat factors drive teaching a MOOC?\u201d in the context of advanced STEM courses. This study explores instructor perspectives through semi-structured interviews with 14 instructors of advanced STEM MOOCs who were identified through purposive sampling. Following transcription, we performed thematic analysis to identify underlying themes. A set of nine themes fell into two main categories: personal factors and situational factors. While the expression of these themes varied from one instructor to the next, the consistent presence of each theme suggests the value of incorporating the themes into a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of a MOOC.", "authors": [{"name": "Nathan M.

This ability to work collaboratively can be as important to a project's success as their technical skills. Traditionally in STEM education, these collaborative skills are developed in a capstone course which mimics an industry experience. These experiences are invaluable in preparing students for the collaborative real-world nature of industry; however, these experiences can also be very stressful for students in dysfunctional teams with members who haven't developed necessary social, technical or teamwork skills. Although students may be exposed to some team-based activities in previous courses, it is not clear that this piecemeal exposure teaches students to work in teams effectively. Flipped classroom and active learning attempt to fill this gap by exposing students to peer learning earlier in the curriculum. However, these techniques are peppered throughout the curriculum and may not target all the skills necessary for teamwork. Design patterns in education formalize pedagogical approaches. But, applying design patterns without an intended progression or overarching goal may not lead students to successfully adopt these skills. Design patterns have the potential to scaffold students' development throughout the curriculum, but only if staged effectively and systematically. In this paper, we propose Spectrums and Dependency Graphs to ensure that students are prepared for each new design pattern as they experience it. Spectrums can plot design patterns along a continuum between introductory and capstone courses. Dependency graphs recursively specify patterns that prepare students for subsequent patterns. Each pattern will contain prerequisite skills or experiences that students have demonstrated in a previous pattern. In this way, students are systematically progressed from introductory to capstone courses.

In this system students are given up to three opportunities to solve each problem correctly. A solution must be essentially correct (minor errors only) in order for points to be awarded, otherwise a retake is required on a similar problem with the points awarded for a correct solution reduced with each retake. Although the effectiveness of this system has been evaluated qualitatively through student and faculty opinion, there has been no performance-based evaluation of the difference in student learning between the mastery system and the traditional partial credit system. This paper describes the results of a comparative study conducted during the spring 2015 semester on four sections of Strength of Materials (SOM). Students in each section (117 total students) of the SOM class were divided into a \u201cmastery\u201d group or a \u201cpartial credit\u201d group such that there was no statistical difference between the GPA's of the two groups. Both groups took the same five initial exams during the semester, with the mastery group exams graded as described above and the partial credit group exams graded using a partial credit system. The partial credit group was not able to retake any of the exams. All students took a common final exam, which was graded on a partial credit basis, and the results of the two groups were compared. The final exam consisted of ten concept questions, five fundamentals problems, and three typical exam problems with all problems graded using partial credit. The results of this study showed that there was no significant difference in the total exam score between the two groups, nor was there a difference on the concept questions, fundamentals problems, and the first two typical exam problems. The students in the mastery group did perform better on the third typical exam problem (p-value 0.03). Based on these results it appears that mastery grading does not improve student comprehension of fundamental concepts, but that repeated practice does make them better able to solve specific problems. Sixty-two of these students were enrolled in a course for the fall 2015 semester which requires SOM as a prerequisite. The students were fortuitously evenly distributed as to GPA and the exam method from the previous course. During the first week of the fall semester, a prerequisite quiz consisting of the concept questions and fundamentals problems from the spring SOM final was administered, and the results from the two groups were compared.

Exploring the implications of authenticity for student achievement and the ways in which this should be assessed has led to innovative teaching methods and ways of evaluating student performance. Unfortunately, authenticity, and authentic assessment in particular, are concepts which are open to a range of interpretations, not least in an educational context where they may be used by both teachers and students with a variety of meanings. This paper investigates the working definitions of authentic assessment used by teaching staff within a Computing department in one U.K. university. We begin by giving an overview of some relevant aspects of authentic learning, which, historically, draws on pedagogies such as situated learning and social learning theory. We then focus on authenticity in the assessment process and describe a number of models which have been used to identify elements that contribute to this range of meaning. We analyse the descriptions of authentic assessment given by academic staff in terms of these concepts and suggest a framework which can be used to integrate the responses and characterise staff understanding of the authenticity.

At the beginning of the 2016 II semester, the Teaching Mentoring Program was designed, consisting of five stages: 1. first contact and interview with the teacher, 2. personalized training, 3. programming and revision of class material, 4. accompaniment in classroom and evaluation by rubrics, and 5. feedforward and recognition. For this, psychological strategies such as rapport, positive reinforcement and behavioral modeling were adapted, as well as the tool of coaching feedforward and evaluation rubrics were designed for the application of active methodologies. To guarantee the effectiveness of the program was a team of two specialists in active methodologies and ICT tools. Work schedule and control of man hours was approached using Gantt diagram. The results of the implementation of the program are relevant, since 95% of the teachers of the semester 2016 II applied active methodologies and ICT tools; in comparison to the result of the 2016 I semester. Tecsup Norte becomes the first site that exceeds the established goal of 80% in application of active methodologies and ICT tools, through the Teaching Mentoring program, the other venues that did not apply the Teaching Mentoring Program were: Tecsup Centro 62% and Tecsup Sur 50%. This educational innovation contributes a program for the training, accompaniment and evaluation of the teaching performance through active methodologies, such as: Flipped learning, case-based learning, problem-based learning, guided-learning project and the use of ICT tools.", "authors": [{"name": "Nonie E.

The engineering classroom is currently experiencing a shift towards more active learning activities due to both advances in educational research, and advances in technologies that enable practices such as the flipped classroom model. Given that course transformation is a gradual process that begins at the level of the instructor, educators need access to the essential tools and training in order to introduce these changes into the curricula. This paper introduces a course re-design based on Self-Determination Theory and Constructivism; and outlines effectively implemented active learning strategies using the flipped classroom model. The data were collected from a Numerical Analysis course, which is an important course across several engineering disciplines at Universidad EAFIT. This course enables engineering students to solve complex problems using mathematical and computational methods. This paper describes the implementation of an online active learning platform called \u201cNum\u00e9rico Interactivo\u201d for two related engineering courses: Numerical Analysis (NA) and Numerical Processes (NP). The platform was available to all students, but only NA implemented it using a flipped classroom model. NP made the platform available as an optional course tool. Informed by SDT principles, \u201cNum\u00e9rico Interactivo\u201d includes a variety of instructional materials such as explanations, examples, frequently asked questions (FAQ), self-assessment tools, and evaluation. This study compares the two courses in terms of: (1) students' perceptions about the instructional materials of the course; (2) students' use of the platform; and (3) students' perceived usefulness of the different elements within the platform. Results suggest that students in the NA course found the classroom sessions and the homework assignments more useful as compared to the students enrolled in the NP course. In addition, in the NA course students used the platform more often for class preparation and to study before each module. The way in which the platform was implemented in NA also increased student motivation in the course. Overall, the results suggest that \u201cNum\u00e9rico Interactivo\u201d is useful to implement course re-designs into engineering and computing education courses, but such tools need to be guided by active learning practices so that students can fully benefit from them.", "authors": [{"name": "Camilo Vieira", "affiliation": "Department of Computer and Information Technology, Purdue University West Lafayette, IN"}, {"name": "Francisco Jose Correa Zabala", "affiliation": "Departamento de Inform\u00e1tica y Sistemas, Universidad EAFIT, Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u00a0"}, {"name": "Heidi E.

Researchers have shown that peer assessment has the potential to provide students more copious, timely and helpful feedback, and also helping reviewers to learn as well. In recent decades, peer assessments in educational settings have increasingly been facilitated by online tools. Some MOOC platforms also rely on aggregated peer-assessment scores to assign grades for each artifact. However, in peer assessment, students can potentially game this process, and thereby harm the validity and reliability of the aggregated scores. Most of instructors assume that the majority of the students' peer assessments are honest since most of the peer assessment is done in double-blind fashion. This assumption only holds in the absence of organized collusion \u2014 when no more than a small number of students game the peer assessment and give each other very high scores. This paper identifies two types of collusion that we have observed. They are small-circle collusion and pervasive collusion. Small-circle collusion refers to the behaviors of students who form small circles and give higher peer review grades to each other. Pervasive collusion refers to students assigning top grades to all the submissions they review. We also present our algorithms for detecting these two types of colluders.

The proposed teaching approach is essentially a project-based approach, but, with two novel key components that give it the entrepreneurship emphasis. First, the main idea is to divide students into groups of four or five members and have each team go through the process of starting-up a company. This process tries to emulate all steps through which entrepreneurs go when a new start-up idea is taken from concept to product realization. These steps include proposing a novel start-up idea, writing a business plan, coming up with a solution, implementing and testing the solution, and reporting results. The only constraint of this \u201cexercise\u201d is that all start-up ideas must be related to the main topic of the course, which in our case is that of advanced hardware description language and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) digital design. As a second component, each student is required to maintain a so called individual reflective journal (IRJ). Students add new entries of about half a page each week to the IRJ, which plays the role of a diary. The objective of this component is to engage students in thinking about how the course activities tie into the three components of the KEEN framework: curiosity, connections, and creation of value.

S. dual degree in Innovation, Leadership, and Engineering Entrepreneurship (ILEE), a second bachelor's degree option for those completing their degree in a traditional engineering discipline. This is unlike many universities where similar degree programs are situated in colleges of business rather than engineering. The first cohort of sixteen students has joined the program in January 2017. In this paper we first report on the stated goals of the new degree, which is meant to combine the technical expertise in the traditional engineering science-focused disciplines with a deeper set of skills in problem-finding, creativity, innovation, leadership, and externalization. The idea is to ensure training in the dual physical and human dimensions and triple aspects of science, design, and leadership that are present in engineering practice. Next we report on the curriculum design as well as the experiential learning pedagogy that is present in most of the courses therein. Core courses include \u201cDesign Thinking/Need-Finding\u201d, \u201cCreativity, Innovation, Vision\u201d, \u201cEmotional Intelligence\u201d, \u201cInnovation and Engineering Design\u201d, and \u201cTechnology Entrepreneurship\u201d. Further, we provide a characterization of the students in the first cohort of undergraduate students to be accepted into the degree program. Drawing on their application materials, we perform text analytics using techniques such as topic modeling under Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and geometric embedding using the word2vec family of methods, to understand the key motivations for students to pursue this degree. Finally we use these text analytics techniques to make a formal assessment of alignment between the stated goals of the degree program and the key motivations of the students.

The use of the rubrics ranged from supporting learning outcomes, to marking students' work, to developing course materials. The professors appreciated the efficiency and effectiveness of receiving individual support to develop these assessment tools, as they cited time as an impediment to designing and using rubrics.

In the existing literature, the eye-tracking based visual attention was studied to infer the testee's cognitive progress towards a specific MC question. However, there is little work on the visual attention based evaluation of one complete MC test. In this paper, we measure the eye movement data of a group of students in an online test, which consists of forty more MC questions. We divide the screen area into five AOIs (area of interests), including one for the question and four for the candidate options. The fixation duration as well as the gaze sequence on these AOIs are recorded and studied. In the case study on the most difficult question, we observe the great differences among the eye movement of the testees in different academic levels. A new metric, namely Visual-Attention-assisted Score (VAS), is proposed to assess the student's performance with the bias of his fixations on the correct options.

Yet, discipline-based education research still tends to focus on students' outcomes from EBPs, rather than on how to successfully sustain the use of those EBPs. Because of students' transient engagement with STEM higher education (i.e., a four-to five-year window), STEM education reformers should not rely on them as the primary change agents for sustained transformation of the culture in STEM fields, especially when instructors can spend decades in the STEM higher education context and touch the lives of thousands of students. That is, rather than asking about students' outcomes from EBPs, the truly transformative questions are a) given all of the evidence that EBPs are effective, why are so many instructors still unwilling to abandon straight didactic lecture, and b) why are EBP-supportive instructors still referred to as the \u201cchoir,\u201d rather than the norm?

PBL is strongly fundamented in well defined principles. Thus, it is fundamentally important that teachers and students implement PBL in conformity to its principles. Once these principles are addressed, PBL brings a collaborative and interactive learning process between all participants. On the other hand, many teachers and students implement PBL without the necessary theoretical and practical base for the educational changes and appropriate technology resource support, putting PBL's quality and authenticity at risk, making it less efficient. In the attempt to overcome these challenges, this paper presents the usage of a virtual learning environment called PBL-Coach, which promoted technological support to an array of actions based in the principles and characteristics originated from learning theories about PBL in a year 8 class of Physics at Tara International School, in Raison, Himachal Pradesh, India, with the objective of helping teachers and students in the implementation of an authentic learning process with useful and relevant technological support. The implementation of PBL at Tara International School brought satisfactory results, reflected in the students' high level of learning, which was demonstrated in the 360 degrees evaluation and in que quality of the solutions for the problem.

Grounded in constructivist teaching and learning theory, scaffolding historically referring to support provided by a teacher to a student. However, in the modern learning environment, instructors have access to a wide range of tools and techniques with which to help them scaffold learners [2]. This paper reports the findings of a design experiment comparing the employment of two instructional scaffolding strategies in reducing the impact of large laboratory class size on undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory computer programming course having a mandatory laboratory component. The design experiment compared the performance of students on programming procedural knowledge assessments as well as programming self-beliefs in two offerings of the course, each treated as a cohort, which differed in the instructional scaffolding strategy employed in the mandatory laboratory component. In one cohort, an undergraduate teaching assistant was used as a supplement to the laboratory instructor while students completed programming exercises in the laboratory component of the course. In the other cohort, a cooperative programming methodology known as pair programming was used as a supplement to the laboratory instructor while students completed programming exercises in the laboratory component of the course. Cohort composition, including school of study (e.g., Liberal Arts, Science, Technology, Engineering, Business, etc.), student classification (i.e., freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, or other), gender ratio, and amount of prior programming experience, was comparable. Course content, administrative processes and assessment mechanisms (formative and summative) remained constant. Each student completed a summative assessment of programming procedural knowledge at weeks 7, 12, and 16 of the semester. Open ended feedback was solicited from each student via anonymous questionnaire during weeks 8 and 16 of the semester. Finally, each student completed a 19-item Likert-scale questionnaire investigating their self-beliefs on 5 constructs: debugging self-efficacy, programming self-concept, programming interest, programming anxiety, and programming aptitude mindset. The questionnaire employed to investigate self-beliefs is based on the Scott & Ghinea [3] instrument, modified for use in the specific context of the course. Our results indicate that the two scaffolding strategies provided comparable support to student learning during the first 12 weeks of the semester. However, during the last 4 weeks of the semester, the cohort scaffolded by a supplemental teaching assistant slightly outperformed the cohort scaffolded by employment of the pair programming methodology. This performance difference, though small, was statistically significant. Student programming self-beliefs, however, remained comparable between cohorts throughout the entire semester. Interestingly, the theme of \u2018immediacy of assistance\u2019 revealed itself during analysis of student open-ended feedback in both cohorts.

Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test.

In this paper we present a tool to source code quality evaluation aimed at supporting students to improve their source code and, consequently, their programming skills. The proposed tool uses quality reports (available to professional environment integrate with software repositories) to analyze students' source code and provide a feedback about the student coding. The proposed tool run locally, with few computational resources. In addition, we proposed the methodology to use the proposed tool: it consists of challenging students to perform a set of maintenance tasks in a controlled environment. We prepared a source code by introducing common defects, what decreases the quality of source code, and ask to students to perform maintenance tasks in order to both eliminate the introduced defects and introduce new features. After each modification, the students must evaluate their code using the proposed tool to obtain a feedback about quality of source code. To evaluate the approach and the tool, we created a survey and applied to students and the teacher. As a result, we show the benefits of using the proposed tool to both teachers and students perspectives.

According to the KERN Entrepreneurship Education Network, facets of an EM include curiosity, an emphasis on creating value, and the ability to make connections. While extracurricular activities are the primary mechanism by which this topic has been introduced to engineering students in the past, it is beginning to show up in more formal ways. The literature includes examples many of how to promote entrepreneurship and an EM in traditional project-based courses engineering students take (senior design, etc.); but there are fewer examples and best practices for cultivating an EM in a fundamental engineering course-namely engineering statistics. Project-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach that involves active learning directed at investigating and solving complex, real-world problems- and it is an approach that is underutilized in math-intensive engineering courses. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how PBL can be integrated into an undergraduate engineering statistics course to promote an entrepreneurial mindset and investigate its impact on student learning. Six teams of engineering students in a 200-level engineering statistics courses responded to the challenge of presenting \u201cA World Without Statistics\u201d. Teams were given liberty to choose any topic of interest and received funding to support their idea. The resulting projects creatively conveyed what the world would be like without statistics using a myriad of topics: sports, resilient infrastructure, online data, robotics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing. Evidence suggest that curiosity, an emphasis on understanding the value of statistics, and the ability to make connections were critical to each team's success.

This integration is a moving target where new methods, tools and applications appear and disappear at such rates that teachers must have confidence to independently and continuously explore what is new, what is relevant and how to plan their pedagogic activities to include digital competences. In this context approaches which can be used to study self-efficacy in digital competences among school teachers are desperately needed. With such a tool in place, we can make a baseline study and then follow teachers over time to measure changes in their self-efficacy, the cause of these changes and learn how to build their digital competence self-efficacy in different ways.

However, many engineering educators and industry employers continue to express concerns about the quality of these skills in engineering graduates. Many universities and institutions have enhanced engineering education curriculum, with a focus on developing communication skills through design courses and presentation activities. However, a consistent assessment or investigation of these skills remains elusive. One way to learn about students' communication skills is to monitor their self-efficacy in communication (i.e. their belief in their capability to communicate effectively). In this study, we discuss the results from a 32-item survey (subset of a 72-item survey) given to engineering students during the second (N = 103) and last week (N = 82) of a 10-week, hands-on engineering design course. 31 items on the survey were related to specific communication tasks such as explaining product details to customers, and the last item was related to general communication skills. A subset of the 31 items were grouped into two categories related to the audience with whom the students are communicating and the method of communication. A one-way ANOVA analysis, and paired t-tests were conducted to determine if the responses to the items within and across the themes were statistically different, and if there was a significant change in the students' self-efficacy from the second to last week of course. The correlation between the students' responses to general communication skills and specific communication activities were also compared. Students reported a significant increase in their self-efficacy in being able to communicate effectively. However, the data was more nuanced when the self-efficacy in the specific communication items and the grouped items were compared. Self-efficacy is believed to be an essential part of a person's attitudes, abilities, and cognitive skills. By using this assessment and investigation, we can begin to understand how the graduating engineers may approach goals, tasks and challenges related to communication in the real world.", "authors": [{"name": "Gabriel N.

In order to efficiently proceed with the aforementioned development, model-based development employing computer simulation is considered effective. Model-based development is performed according to a development process called the \u201cV-type development process (V-process).\u201d This process includes the operations of model in the loop simulation and hardware in the loop simulation. However, several professional engineers involved in automobile development have insufficient experience in conducting model-based development.

The program is implemented to target 159 professional engineers belonging to Mazda Motor Corporation. In the learning program, exercises for motor control system using \u201cMATLAB/Simulink\u201d are performed. Additionally, hardware in the loop simulation exercises using a simple simulator exclusively developed for this purpose, and control experiments with an actual motor control system are conducted.

In the fall semester of 2014, at a large public university in the Midwest, TAs were observed in the laboratory sections of a required, junior-level course in general engineering. Additional data were obtained from student reflections in each laboratory report and an end of semester survey. Reflections were also collected from students enrolled in the same course in the spring semester of 2015. Finally, at the end of the spring semester, students from both semesters participated in a focus group about the course. The data were analyzed using values coding, which identified values, beliefs, and attitudes expressed by students about the course or the TA. Due to the TAs' prominent role in the laboratory setting, they had a direct impact on the students' experience in the laboratory. However, the impact was different among students who had the same TA. Some of the negative impacts reported were unclear expectations for success, inconsistent grading, and being unavailable or unhelpful. Some positive impacts were also reported, including being helpful and patient. Since data were only collected from the students, the motivations of the TAs were not clear. In this study, there was evidence that the TAs had a negative impact on the learning experience for some students, but not all.

The study of fractional calculus, fractional-order systems (FOS) and the applications thereof have been of interest to many scientists and engineers as evidenced in the recent exponential growth in the number of corresponding research publications worldwide. One particular area of study is fractional-order control design due to the additional flexibility in tuning the controllers that fractional-order calculus provides. Although there is a wide growth in research productivity in this particular area, the number of educational resources are still limited while researchers and students would find their own respective ways to understand the concepts of fractional calculus and how fractional-order systems and controls work. The goal of this contribution is to establish a simple but effective set of teaching tools that can be used by students and researchers in understanding concepts of fractional calculus and its applications, especially on FOS and more specifically on control design. The MATLAB tool currently being developed is a graphical user interface (GUI) that is designed to show the time and frequency responses of FOS models and the primary function of which is to study basics of fractional PID controller design.

RETAIN represents a professional development model for providing high school teachers with laboratory research experiences in nanoscience and related content areas. In this intensive summer program, teachers spend six weeks conducting nanotechnology-related research in an IUPUI lab. As part of the RETAIN program, teachers complete six credit hours of coursework, wherein they translate their research experiences into the design of classroom modules. Teachers are expected to then implement their modules within their own classrooms during the subsequent academic year. This evaluation focuses on teachers' experiences in IUPUI labs during the summer of 2016, along with three teachers' implementation of nanotechnology labs within their courses during the 2016\u20132017 school year. To evaluate RETAIN, we explored teacher satisfaction, changes in teachers' content knowledge and nanotechnology perceptions, as well as changes in teachers' epistemological beliefs. Further, we explored the impact of the three teachers' module integration on their students' STEM attitudes and nanotechnology perceptions. The findings indicated that teachers were generally satisfied with the research and course experiences. Further, as a result of RETAIN participation, teachers showed increased nanotechnology content knowledge and knowledge of nanotechnology-related careers. Lastly, three teachers' integration of nanotechnology modules indicated that their students had significantly improved perceptions of nanotechnology's potential coupled with more knowledge of nanotechnology-related careers.

As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course.

The user layer, long recognized as the weakest link in the security chain, has had little to no attention paid to it by comparison, especially from a sociotechnical perspective which is comparatively new to engineering. Thus steps have to be taken then to instill safe cyber security practices in the general computer user, overcoming their propensity to act without forethought for the consequence of their actions, including ignoring warning messages, visiting unsafe websites, and communicating with unauthenticated entities. While there are significant studies that show the importance of game-based learning for the process of cognitive development and learning concepts of students, there have been relatively few papers or attempts at presenting forms of assessing the potential of these resources.

Mobile robotics has been taught at this university for 10 years and the course has proven to be very successful. The challenge with this success is that there is only one instructor, one section, once per year with an enrollment cap of 24 students. These constraints are due to faculty workload, classroom size as well as available robots. Although more robots can be purchased, it is not possible to add more faculty to teach the course or change the classroom. The other challenges are the need to elevate the laboratory assignments to focus on high level technical aspects of mobile robotics control and provide more student assistance. In order to resolve this dilemma, the author feels that there must be more time in class to focus on the laboratory recitation and assignments while emphasizing background theory both online and in class. Therefore, in winter quarter 2016 the mobile robotics course was flipped to resolve some of these challenges. The lectures were moved online and the classroom time was spent on lab recitation, implementation, and demonstration.

We prompted students in an entry-level biomedical engineering course that used the PSS approach to reflect on their motivation for the course and their approach to learning. We coded the students' responses, quantized them, and used cluster analysis to identify groups of students with similar response profiles. We identified four groups of students whose perceptions of their experience in PSS differed with respect to their motivation and approaches to learning, but whose demographics (with respect to age, gender, grades, and minority-status) were similar. We used these results as a guide to determine who to invite to participate in the second phase of our study.

It was validated through non-parametric test from Mac Nemar, with a confidence level of 95%. Conclusion is PBL turned out to be highly effective, especially at highest levels of academic performance (demanding application and analysis skills) in which there are found substantial differences with regard of group of control. On the other hand, in area of comprehension, such a difference was not noticed, which indicates that application of above-mentioned methodology (regarding this capability) is not interesting for teacher.

Many programs have already switched from the traditional educational boards to, for example Arduino products, due to their low costs, easy to use, flexibility, and wide adoption in both consumer and industrial applications. However, comparing with their commercial counterparts, open source boards still lack rigorous and well-designed teaching, especially lab materials to have a seamless integration with existing curricular. Engine systems and controls is a core course in automotive engineering (AET) program that teaches students the theory and application of on-board diagnostics and monitoring system. The course has an intense lab component. Despite the consensus that AET curriculum needs more mechatronics material to reflect the critical roles that electrical, electronics, computing, communications, controls and software technologies play in today's vehicles, we find that nationwide, the lab facility of automotive programs are still heavily mechanical. We believe open source MCU boards are the ideal tool to develop new educational equipment and materials to transform automotive labs and to bridge the gap between classroom and industry knowledge base. In this work-in-progress paper we first introduce the Arduino shields for engine sensing and communication that we have designed at the request of, and in collaboration with AET faculty.

As a case study, the model was used in the development of Gaia Abstraction Game Object Orientation, which aims to assist the teaching and learning process of the Object-Oriented paradigm - one of the most complex concepts in current computing theory. Since this paradigm works mostly with objects abstraction and classification, the concept is not always clear for the students, even though it is core for the initial subjects in computing courses.
