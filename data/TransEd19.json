[{"title": "Using a 3-D Printed Mechatronics Project to Simulate MEMS Design and Fabrication", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8337095/", "abstract": "Contribution: A semester-long project, geared towards a multidisciplinary group of undergraduate engineering students, to design and simulate a large-scale microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) 2-D optical scanner is presented. Background: MEMS component design and fabrication typically requires a cleanroom and costly high-vacuum equipment; these are not available at many small educational institutions. Conventionally, institutions without cleanroom access teach MEMS courses using lectures and videos, but this fails to engage and motivate students because of the absence of hands-on fabrication and design experience. Application Design: The mechatronics project has students use simple accessible tools, including 3-D printing, servomotors, a microcontroller, and mechanical simulation software to design and optimize a large-scale model of a MEMS optical scanner that simulates the 2-D motion of the actual device. Intended Outcomes: This project involves a hands-on approach designed to improve the participating students' understanding of MEMS devices; its design and process constraints closely resemble aspects of the MEMS industry. Application Design: In addition to a detailed description of the various components of the project, this paper describes methods to assess student progress, and gives reflections on the project's implementation. The effectiveness of the project is evaluated through assessment data obtained from a total of 65 students over three semesters. Findings: After introducing the project to the course, instructors saw a great increase in interest, and an improvement in performance. Students showed a significant improvement in their understanding of mask design and fabrication process description, as demonstrated by their final exam grades.", "authors": [{"name": "Sean Hart", "affiliation": "Division of Engineering Programs, State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, NY, USA"}, {"name": "Kevin Hart", "affiliation": "Division of Engineering Programs, State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, NY, USA"}, {"name": "Reena Dahle", "affiliation": "Division of Engineering Programs, State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, NY, USA"}], "tags": ["three-dimensional printing", "Solid modeling", "MEMS industry", "student progress", "fabrication", "undergraduate engineering students", "interdisciplinary", "educational courses", "mechatronics", "mechanical simulation software", "process constraints", "micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices", "optical scanners", "active learning", "MEMS optical scanner", "educational institutions", "mask design", "MEMS courses", "computer aided instruction", "MEMS design", "high-vacuum equipment", "mechatronics project", "large-scale model", "technology-enhanced learning", "Optical device fabrication", "Integrated optics", "large-scale microelectromechanical systems 2-D optical scanner", "Application Design", "engineering education", "MEMS component design", "microfabrication", "microactuators", "masks", "three-dimensional modeling", "semester-long project", "micromechanical devices", "cleanroom access", "teaching", "CAD", "Printing", "multidisciplinary group", "microcontrollers", "MEMS devices", "Optical design", "Micromechanical devices", "Design project"]}, {"title": "Practical Epistemic Cognition in a Design Project\u2014Engineering Students Developing Epistemic Fluency", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8703388/", "abstract": "Contribution: This paper reports engineering students' practical epistemic cognition by studying their interactional work in situ. Studying \u201cepistemologies in action\u201d the study breaks away from mainstream approaches that describe this in terms of beliefs or of stage theories. Background: In epistemology, knowledge is traditionally seen as \u201cjustified true belief,\u201d neglecting knowledge related to action. Interest has increased in studying the epistemologies people use in situated action, and their development of epistemic fluency. How appropriate such approaches are in engineering and design education need further investigation. Research Questions: 1) How do students in the context of a design project use epistemic tools in their interactional work? and 2) What are the implications of the findings in terms of how students' cognitive and epistemological development could be conceptualized? Methodology: A collaborative group of six students were video recorded on the 14th day of a fifth-semester design project, as they were preparing for a formal critique session. The entire, almost 6 h, session was recorded by four video cameras mounted in the design studio, with an additional fifth body-mounted camera. The video data collected was analyzed using video ethnographic, conversation analysis, and embodied interaction analysis methods. Findings: The results show that the students use a wealth of bodily material resources as an integral and seamless part of their interactions as epistemic tools, in their joint production of understanding and imagining.

Background: Interdisciplinarity as a learning goal is prevalent across engineering education literature. However, without organizational support structures to guide faculty members in developing interdisciplinary courses, interdisciplinarity as a student learning outcome is difficult to sustain. There is a need to evolve existing organizational structures faculty navigate when creating interdisciplinary courses, so that competing organizational systems do not stifle interdisciplinarity. Moreover, educators' effort in developing interdisciplinary courses is mirrored in the uncertain processes in which instructors engage students. Research Questions: In settings of interdisciplinary curriculum design and implementation, how do interdisciplinary faculty collaborations parallel that of their student design teams? How do organizational structures affect interdisciplinary faculty teams designing courses that span disciplines? Methodology: The study used a qualitative case, bound by three required courses in a new interdisciplinary undergraduate minor. Data was collected via interviews, class observations, and student reflection assignments. Analysis was guided by the conceptual frameworks of King and Kitchener's reflective judgment model and strange and banning's conceptualization of campus learning environments. Findings: Both educators and students develop through the discomfort with uncertainty-a prevalent theme in complex problem-solving. Forms of summative assessment pose an added challenge for both groups as they negotiate organizational structures.

This paper presents a cost-effective modified bright-mode prism coupler that helps students learn optical waveguides, and enhances their knowledge and skills for building an optical system. Background: Commercial dark-mode prism couplers have little educational value, while measurement error for homemade manual dark-mode prism couplers is likely to be unacceptable. Therefore, students need an automated, accurate prism coupler system to learn basic concepts of the design, assembly, testing and validation of an entire optical system. Intended Outcomes: An automatic measurement system can help students learn optical waveguides and prism coupling. Assembling a prism coupler system helps them understand the software and hardware design, testing and validation of an optical system. Then, conducting experiments helps them develop their abilities in implementing an optical system. Application Design: Four design principles were followed: the modified bright-mode automatic prism coupler equipment had to be: 1) inexpensive; 2) open, with each part of the system being visible to, and adjustable by students; 3) sufficiently robust to withstand their unskilled adjustments; and 4) capable of being assembled and maintained by students.

Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections.

Methodology: Study 1 (n = 79) included a 60-min workshop model where participants, assigned to treatment and control groups, completed surveys pre- and post-intervention. The treatment group experienced a workshop on computer networking, without any technology. The control group did not receive the workshop. Study 2 (n = 34) was a week-long intervention whose participants had formal lessons, built websites, and defended themselves from an ongoing simulated cyberattack. Participants completed a survey on cybersecurity learning and engagement three times during the intervention. Findings: Study 1 showed no main treatment effect, but females experienced greater gains in problem-solving than males. In Study 2, there was positive growth over time and females experienced greater growth in cybersecurity self-efficacy relative to males.", "authors": [{"name": "Emma Frank", "affiliation": "Department of Organizational Behavior, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"}, {"name": "Shambhu Upadhyaya", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"}, {"name": "Ruochen Liao", "affiliation": "Management Science and Systems Department, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA"}, {"name": "H.

Background: Lack of engagement by students in electric machine courses have been reported across the world. Interventions however, usually take the form of laboratory and simulation assignments. There is little information on, however, the use of blended learning and flipped classroom techniques to combat these problems. Intended Outcomes: Increased engagement in the course evidenced by exam performance. In particular, for the transformer, dc motor, induction motor, and synchronous motor the students should be able to explain the construction and principle of operation, and compute voltages, currents and power for various operating conditions. Application Design: The approach involved online lectures, tutorial submissions, and peer feedback forums followed by face to face tutorial sessions. These were chosen because online activities would allow students to access material on devices with which they are accustomed to engaging deeply and because peer feedback has been shown to build community, and increase the quality of discourse for both students and lecturer.

Background: Habits of Mind refer to mathematical, logical, and attitudinal modes of thinking required for students of science, mathematics, technology, and engineering to become effective problem solvers, capable of transferring such modes to new contexts. These are particularly relevant in a signal processing course in which students must learn to address engineering problems using tools and techniques previously acquired in an abstract context (mathematics). Research Questions: 1) What are the different Habits of Mind patterns exhibited by the students? 2) Are some of these patterns associated with differences in course grades? Methodology: A qualitative method is combined with random signal modeling and machine learning. Students' work is first annotated manually based on a custom-built rubric of Habits of Mind. Data is modeled and clustered to obtain statistically significant patterns of Habits of Mind corresponding to divisions of the students into groups. Findings: The data obtained suggests that the student group is inhomogeneous in terms of their Habits of Mind, and this inhomogeneity is associated with grade differences.

Research designs have considered aspects of usability, attractiveness and users' collaboration. Existing findings are not clear. Methodological issues, e.g., limitations of simple statistics, may have limited the clarify and usefulness of findings to date. The present study explores children's preferences profiles.

Methodology: Children (N=148) aged from six to 13 years old participated in this paper. Eight variables related to the attractiveness, collaboration, and usability factors for the tangible and graphical programming interfaces were measured and analyzed by Latent Class Analysis, a model-based clustering method that can reveal distinct preference-profiles and associate them with individual differences.

Background: Prior studies have shown inclusion of creativity within engineering syllabi and course activities are generally limited. Students may perceive educators do not value creativity, and their studies have limited influence on their creative skills. Studies conflict on whether creativity skills increase over completing an engineering degree. Creativity has been demonstrated to be an important skill for engineering professionals, but one not necessarily appropriately addressed in engineering programs. Few studies have attempted to quantify coverage of creativity material on a nation-wide scale, as opposed to in a single or select few institutions.

Background: Research has shown that students benefit from active learning, but instructors still perceive many barriers to implementing it. Flexible classrooms may reduce some of these barriers, and their affordances may promote better student engagement and allow instructors to use more active learning than traditional lecture-style classrooms do. Research Questions: What are the differences in the amount of active learning used by an instructor between flexible classrooms and traditional classrooms? How do instructors and students use the affordances of flexible classrooms during active learning? Methodology: An instructor at a large Midwestern university taught the course Introduction to Electronics Circuits in a traditional classroom one semester and in a flexible classroom the next. The two research questions were addressed through complementary quantitative and qualitative analyses of video data, classroom observations, and instructor interviews to detail the amount of active learning and the way the instructor facilitated it in the flexible classroom. Findings: The time the instructor devoted to active learning increased in the flexible classroom, while the time she devoted to instructor-led examples decreased.

Background: Many electrical engineering curricula offer a PE courses (PECs) for third- or fourth-year undergraduate students. Prior research on PEs education mainly focused on improving students' experimental skills through developing practical experiments, laboratory activities, and problem/project-based learning. An instructional approach that instead employs real-world knowledge and skills is worth evaluating. Intended Outcomes: Students should be able to consider realworld technical and non-technical limitations when applying theory to design PE circuits and converters, and be able to select and carry out appropriate tests to troubleshoot circuits. Application Design: Prior research on engineering education emphasized the importance of introducing real-world limitations to the students as part of their curriculum. This paper suggests that the tutorial activities presented in a PEC can help students acquire skills in designing and troubleshooting a circuit or system according to desired technical aspects, real-world limitations, and available data.

General guidelines and specific tools are available to help educators adapt digital content and existing learning platforms for access by students with varying abilities/capacities. Such tools are usually for a specific disability rather than a range of capacities, and few provide empirical evidence of effectiveness.

This model is extendable for other types of disabilities, helping educators adapt existing content for access by students with differing capacities.

Background: To improve the current educational system, investigation and quantification is needed of the \u201csilos.\u201d Cognitive distance-a measure of the differences in background, culture, and expertise between collaborators-may be a factor influencing the lack of quality and variety in research outputs. Addressing this is a key enabler for fruitful collaboration. Research Question: Does collaboration with similarly expert researchers yield better research? Methodology: A quantitative survey provides baseline data for cognitive distance while publication data allowed creation of a co-authorship network between 123 researchers in a European computing research department. The network was analyzed through quantitative and qualitative research methods. Findings: Increased expertise overlaps across sub-fields of computing is a strong predictor for further collaboration (quantity), but research impact (quality) decreases with larger overlaps. This reveals an educational silo effect in doctoral computing education and, consequently, a flaw in the connected research output. The lack of a single, agreed way to evaluate research impact across sub-fields further hinders cross-departmental collaboration among doctoral students.

Background: Prior studies of engineering identity on undergraduates identified several factors (e.g., engineering interest and engineering recognition) as positive predictors of identification of engineering. Engineering competence, achieved by participating in design projects, is a crucial part of students' efforts to become more innovative engineers. Identity theory is used to understand undergraduates' persistence in engineering, as students with stronger engineering identification are more likely to persist. More work is needed focusing on graduate students. Research Questions: Do engineering identity measurement frameworks studied for undergraduate students also apply to graduate students? Do they correlate with intention to complete the degree? What predicts the engineering identity of engineering master's and doctoral students? Methodology: Interviews informed development and adaptation of a multi-scale survey instrument. Factor analyses identified four factors that relate to graduate engineering identity: 1) engineering interest; 2) engineering recognition; 3) engineering competence; and 4) interpersonal skills competence. Three sequential multiple linear regression models were used to predict engineering graduate students' engineering identity. Findings: The final regression model, which includes student characteristics and the four factors resulting from confirmatory factor analysis, predicts 60% of the variance in engineering identity-substantially more than similar undergraduate engineering identity models.

Background: PBL has been widely adopted in engineering education for its effectiveness in improving students' problem-solving abilities, collaboration skills, and academic achievement. The four stages of Perry's theory-Dualism, Multiplicity, Relativism, and Commitment (within Relativism)-depict students' epistemological development from dualistic to contextual relativistic thinking. Prior research suggested that participation in PBL could benefit students' development to relativistic thinking-the most revolutionary change in Perry's model. Nevertheless, how epistemological thinking was exhibited in the context of PBL, and the relationship between students' epistemological thinking and PBL learning activities both remain unclear. Research Questions: 1) What are demonstrations of students' relativistic thinking in PBL activities? and 2) What are the factors in regard to students' relativistic thinking in PBL activities? Methodology: Built upon quantitative results obtained using a modified Zhang's cognitive development inventory (ZCDI) developed in the context of Perry's theory, this paper explored demonstrations of students' relativistic thinking in PBL in a qualitative manner, and analyzed the associated factors based upon one-on-one interviews with 17 engineering students. Findings: In PBL activities, students' epistemological thinking is reflected in their solving problems within constraints, conducting feasibility analyses, exhibiting commercial awareness, having their thinking broadened, and more. Their epistemological thinking can be impacted by factors, such as guidance from professors, collaborations with peers, communications with other stakeholders, and complexity level of projects.", "authors": [{"name": "Tianyi Zheng", "affiliation": "Graduate School of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"}, {"name": "Zhinan Zhang", "affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"}, {"name": "Rongrong Liu", "affiliation": "Graduate School of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"}, {"name": "Jiabin Zhu", "affiliation": "Graduate School of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"}, {"name": "Qunqun Liu", "affiliation": "Dongying Federation of Social Science Associations, Dongying, China"}], "tags": ["modified ZCDI", "Mechanical engineering", "Interviews", "mixed methods research", "Instruments", "Perry's theory-Dualism", "behavioral patterns", "PBL activities", "collaboration skills", "Perry\u2019s model of intellectual development", "Zhang's cognitive development inventory", "computer aided instruction", "Problem-solving", "Collaboration", "cognition", "relativistic thinking", "students' problem-solving abilities", "engineering education", "contextual relativistic thinking", "project-based learning activities", "Engineering students", "Epistemology", "project-based learning", "engineering students epistemological thinking"]}, {"title": "Using Studio Culture to Foster Epistemic Change in an Engineering Senior Design Course", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8653950/", "abstract": "Contribution: This paper furthers understanding of how to use studio culture to develop instruction that supports learners' epistemic development in the context of an engineering senior design course, with a focus on student development of epistemic frames. Background: Current capstone engineering design courses do not integrate the educational theories and practice of cognitive apprenticeship combined with studio culture. Combined, these can be useful constructs for developing instruction that encourages creativity and innovation in a situated, student-centered, and activity-focused environment. Prior research and evidence-based instructional methods from other non-engineering contexts were used to create an instructional environment that engenders epistemic change. Research Questions: How do instructional design methods based on studio culture impact the cognitive and epistemic development of engineering students in a Senior Design course? Methods: This exploratory case study examines the effects of instructional design methods based on studio culture to change an Engineering Senior Design course from lecture-based to activity-based instruction in a collaborative environment. The case study emerges from a design-based research intervention, and uses mixed methods data collection from multiple sources, including video interviews, classroom footage, and written debrief reflections.

Background: Literature from the engineering education community underlines the benefits of reflection-based upon theories, such as Experiential Learning Theory, and calls for additional use of reflection in engineering education and associated scholarly work. Intended Outcomes: The authors intended for students to obtain meaningful academic and professional insights with implications for their future performance and to perform better on subsequent related exams via reflection. Application Design: Post-quiz and post-design reflective exercises were implemented in two electrical and computer engineering courses, Microelectronic Circuits and Advanced Digital Design, to drive student analysis of differences between their designs or calculations and the \u201cstandard solution\u201d using simulation software and question prompts. Reflection-on-action was chosen to enhance students' post-activity understanding and insight, as ultimate learning requires reflection whereby students identify errors and strategies for improvement. Findings: Results demonstrated the value of reflection-on-action using post-activity comparisons and simulation. The students' reflective content and interviews demonstrated substantial professional and academic insights from and appreciation for reflection.

This paper discovers this same pattern in electrical engineering (EE) and discovers that prosocial affordance beliefs are significantly associated with intensions to persist, while agency beliefs are not. Background: Goal congruity theory finds that people are more motivated to pursue a career if it aligns with values they endorse. This theory can shed light on why some students do not persist in EE because of the stereotype that the profession does not allow working with and helping others. Research Questions: This paper seeks to answer whether EE students perceive the profession as affording prosocial value, and to test associations between prosocial perceptions and motivation to persist in the field. Methodology: The first study in this paper was conducted on students in an introductory EE course (n = 79) that measured affordance beliefs about the EE profession and tested associations with intensions to persist. The second study compared affordance beliefs and trait endorsements held by students in the introductory level course with those in an advanced EE courses (n = 51). Findings: Mediation analysis revealed that the more novice students believe that EE allows them to fulfill prosocial goals, the greater their persistence intentions (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.34).

However, they also bring challenges in course delivery and assessment, due to factors such as less direct student-instructor interaction. These challenges are especially severe in engineering education, which relies heavily on experiential learning, such as laboratory exercises and computer simulations, to assist students in understanding concepts. As a result, effective design of experiential learning components is extremely critical for engineering MOOCs. Intended Outcomes: This paper shares the experience gained through developing and offering an MOOC on communication systems, with special focus on the development and the automated assessment of MATLAB exercises for active concept learning. Application Design: The proposed approach introduced students to concepts by using learning components commonly provided by many MOOC platforms (e.g., online lectures and quizzes), and augmented the student experience with MATLAB-based computer simulations and exercises to enable more concrete and detailed understanding of the material.

Interactive functionalities offered by existing learning tools are inadequate to achieve the learning objectives of the evolving power engineering curriculum.

The proposed interactive learning tools first assess the student's knowledge level, then based on the results create a specific exercise giving a network model, and a unique set of parameters. The tools include solving assistance with three support-levels; in each level more information is provided to assist with solution process enabling students to recognize specific mistakes in their calculations.

This paper describes this approach, and an evaluation strategy using Perry's model for intellectual development. The results show that students can reach the relativism stage of Perry's model in their first year of studies. Background: Students must move beyond a dualistic worldview to be engineers. Felder and Brent provided a list of recommendations to promote this type of intellectual development in students; active learning strategies strongly align with these recommendations. While active learning is common in programming courses (sometimes taking the form of project-based learning), they are typically tightly controlled by the instructor, and limited in scope (both in time and complexity), potentially reducing their impact on students. Intended Outcomes: This course and term-long project provided students a supportive environment in which to develop their decision-making skills, and promoted their intellectual development through Perry's stages related to software design. Application Design: Aligned with Felder and Brent's recommendations and Kuh's High Impact Practices, a course was built to: 1) teach students procedural programming, with 2) a focus on software design and open-ended problem solving, while maintaining 3) a supportive environment for skill acquisition.

This paper presents an assessment framework whose validity has been proven on a course with over 70 engineering students. Background: There is evidence that on-line resources complement the learning experience in many engineering fields. In the context of optics and photonics, it may be worthwhile to assess the learning experience of engineering students taking a virtual lab as a complement to on-site, traditional lab. The assessment should use empiric, measurable results that demonstrates the effectiveness of the didactic innovation proposed, based on the Technology Acceptance Model. Intended Outcomes: Students using OPTILAB software are expected to be able to demonstrate their learning of optics and photonics by having a good score in the specific question about optical diffraction included in the final exam. Application Design: OPTILAB software, simulating the optical diffraction produced by different apertures, was developed. Students use OPTILAB to check, in advance, the experimental results they will obtain in the on-site lab, with various optical apertures and settings. This is expected to make the on-site lab session more efficient, minimize errors that inevitably occur when students are confronted with a new physical phenomenon, and ultimately increase the students learning experience.
