Typically, this was taught using a simple simulation example of an inverted pendulum. Unfortunately, many difficult issues arise in the learning and understanding of the concepts of stability, instability, and marginal stability. Instead, the authors use an example from dynamic texture, a topic with which undergraduate students with computer science backgrounds are both familiar and comfortable. This example provides the opportunity for students with no access to mechanical or electronic equipment to learn system stability. In addition, the designed project also allows students to improve their knowledge in several fields, such as discrete-time dynamic system analysis, parameter identification of state-space models, and MATLAB programming. The assessment by students reveals that this project is interesting and useful for their studies.", "authors": [{"name": "Fuchun Sun", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Technology, TNLIST, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems TNLIST, Beijing, P.R.

They are also often unaccustomed to instructional materials consisting of a combination of text, diagrams, and equations. This raises the question of whether instruction on elementary electrical circuit analysis for novice learners should employ contextualized representations of the circuits with familiar components, such as batteries, or employ abstract representations with the abstract engineering terms and symbols. A further question is if text labels in the circuit diagrams would aid these learners. This study examined these research questions with a \u201c2 \u00d7 3\u201d experimental design, in which the two forms of representation (abstract or contextualized) were considered under three types of diagram labeling (no labels, static labels, or interactive labels). The design was implemented in an instructional module on elementary circuit analysis for novice learners. Results indicated that abstract representations led to higher near- and far-transfer post-test scores, and that interactive (student-generated) labeling resulted in higher near-transfer scores than either the no-labels or static-labels conditions. These findings suggest that abstract representations promote the development of deep, transferrable knowledge and that generative methods of integration, such as interactive diagram labeling, can facilitate learning with multiple external representations.", "authors": [{"name": "Martin Reisslein", "affiliation": "School of Electrical, Computer, and Energy Eng., Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ"}, {"name": "Kirsten R.

This case study is based on the existing technology of wireless capsule endoscopy and centered on a \u201cgrand challenge\u201d of building a capsule robot to navigate the human gastrointestinal tract to detect abnormality or to destroy malignant tissues. First, a conceptual design example for building such a capsule robot is presented, followed by a laboratory module that demonstrates robot navigation techniques using Webots simulation.

During the practical sessions, the student analyzes the inverse kinematics of parallel structures and the direct kinematic problem. Moreover, LABEL makes it easy to analyze the singularities that appear in the solution of the inverse and direct kinematic problem. These singularities are analyzed through the use of a path planning application, which allows the user to plan a trajectory in the robot's workspace. This helps the student to analyze the position and velocity of the end effector while observing the joint trajectories and speeds of the actuators.

It revealed that beliefs about intelligence and programming aptitude formed two distinct constructs. Furthermore, the mindset for programming aptitude had greater utility in predicting software development practice, and a follow-up survey showed that it became more fixed throughout instruction.

The pedagogical challenge is to enhance students' learning of digital communication using LabVIEW. LabVIEW was extensively used in the laboratory sessions, which better prepared students for the course projects. Two course projects were designed to familiarize the students with virtual instrumentation, data acquisition, Modbus communication, and simple closed-loop control. One project involved the instrumentation and control of a brushed dc permanent magnet motor; the other involved the instrumentation and control of a small-scale temperature chamber. Students used one computer, functioning as a Modbus slave, to measure the motor speed or temperature inside the chamber and to turn the motor or lightbulbs on and off. Another computer, functioning as a Modbus master, reads the measurements using Modbus communication protocol via RS-485 wires, compared the measurements to the set points, made control decisions, and sent the commands to the Modbus slave for actuation. The effectiveness of student learning is analyzed using student survey data.", "authors": [{"name": "Jay R.
