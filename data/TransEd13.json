[{"title": "The Design and Effect of a Scaffolded Concept Mapping Strategy on Learning Performance in an Undergraduate Database Course", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327625/", "abstract": "This paper proposes a scaffolded concept mapping strategy, which considers a student's (high or low) prior knowledge, and provides flexible learning aids (scaffolding and fading) for reading and drawing a concept map. The goal is that the whole class should progress in synchronized fashion through this strategy, with each student achieving meaningful learning. The scaffolding is tailored to the student's needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated software, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy. The paper also investigates whether this strategy improved student learning for 54 undergraduates in a database management system course. The results indicate that the students who used the strategy had better learning achievements than those who only experienced traditional lectures. Moreover, the implementation of the strategy received positive student feedback.", "authors": [{"name": "Hsuan-Hung Chen", "affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"}, {"name": "Kim-Joan Chen", "affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"}, {"name": "Yau-Jane Chen", "affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Curriculum and Instruction, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"}], "tags": ["Navigation", "computer science education", "learning performance", "Software", "Database systems", "synchronized fashion", "learning environment", "Education", "software aids", "undergraduate database course", "concept mapping", "database management systems", "educational courses", "constant evolution", "database systems", "scaffolding", "scaffolded concept mapping strategy", "Fading", "associated software", "Materials", "flexible learning aids", "database management system course", "computer aided instruction", "systematic instructional design", "Computer-aided instruction"]}, {"title": "A New Experiment-Based Way to Introduce Fourier Transform and Time Domain\u2013Frequency Domain Duality", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6476041/", "abstract": "This paper describes a complex multistep problem exercise used in a problem-based learning (PBL) context to introduce the fundamentals of the Fourier transform (FT) and convey the concept of the time domain-frequency domain duality.

Although it is widely accepted that undergraduate students should be introduced to FT, this involves substantial and complex mathematics. In order to avoid this difficulty, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is used as an approximation to the FT because it is easier to use in a computational environment. The CPE uses a practical approach to concepts such as impulse response, sampling theorem, Nyquist frequency, aliasing, and uncertainty and causality principles; it is thought to be of pedagogical interest as an introduction to the FT.

This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful.

Real problems often need to combine the speed of an HW solution with the flexibility of an SW solution. The goals of this course are to show that there are many alternative solutions in the design space and to teach the fundamental concepts of HW/SW co-design. The sample application for the course project is a basic public key (RSA) application. This application is attractive for pedagogic purposes because its complex arithmetic and large word lengths make it difficult to realize in SW on an embedded microcontroller. However, the alternative of a pure application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) application is also not a satisfactory solution, as this lacks the flexibility to support multiple public key applications.

The system can adapt dynamically to each individual learner's needs by scheduling the sequence of learning lessons on the fly.

In general, the results show that students can be trained to carry out authentic programming tasks within one and a half days, even for beginners in programming. The data distinguish the two approaches. Function Block Diagram programming (IEC 61131-3) can be best predicted by the grade in mathematics, programming experience, and cognitive demand. For performance in UML class diagram and state chart (UML/CD+SC) modeling, the grade in mathematics plays an even more prominent role; this explains the greater variance in modeling performance in the UML group than in the 61131/Function Block Diagram group.

For undergraduate students, electromagnetics is typically the most challenging subject in the Electrical Engineering curriculum, and the most challenging component of the subject is the application of vector analysis to electromagnetic field theory and problem solving. According to the geometrical approach, the students are taught to \u201cread\u201d the figure and to \u201ctranslate\u201d this to equations at all times throughout the computation or derivation, instead of their \u201ccrunching\u201d the formulas and numbers without even visualizing the structure. In performing vector manipulations, integrals, and derivatives, the students are taught to always deal with real geometrical entities and quantities (arrows, lengths, angles, points, lines, surfaces, volumes, etc.). They learn to \u201ctranslate\u201d the geometry and the electromagnetic physics attached to it into mathematical models (equations and symbolic or numerical values) using \u201cfirst mathematical principles\u201d instead of just \u201cblack-box\u201d formulas as a computer would do. As opposed to the traditional formal algebraic approach to vector analysis in electromagnetics, which is very general but also very abstract and dry, the geometrical approach is problem-dependent but also much more intuitive and visual, and as such can do a great deal to increase students' understanding and appreciation of vector analysis and its application to electromagnetic theory and problem solving.

For this reason, computer scientists and engineers must understand how the computer manages this interaction, which is usually taught in introductory CA courses. Of course, there are many different styles of teaching, ranging from purely theoretical to completely practical. The CA course considered in this paper has already applied a practical approach for some time. For the I/O subsystem, students must be able to describe what polling and interrupts are and handle them through low-level programming. However, programming at this level in operating system (OS)-driven computers is not possible without being familiar with the kernel and drivers, which is not usually the case for students in an introductory course. Fortunately, there are many bare and specialized embedded systems around that are not OS-driven. In this proposal, the Nintendo DS (NDS) console was used in a classroom setting. It proved to be an appropriate infrastructure for developing attractive and engaging projects and was useful in providing a better understanding of the mechanisms related to the I/O subsystem. At the same time, the teaching methods were altered to make the transition from classical, passive, lecture-based classes to an active project-based learning (PBL) approach. It has been a very rewarding experience to see students learning to control the NDS devices on their own.
