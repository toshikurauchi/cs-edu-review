[{"title": "Inspire, Innovate, Improve!: What does this mean for CS for All?", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3025047", "abstract": "In January 2016, President Obama unveiled the CS for All initiative. With all the attention and publicity surrounding CS for All and increased support from a variety of corners over the ensuing year, it is easy to become complacent and start believing that we have \"arrived\". During her 2016 SIGCSE keynote, Jan Cuny talked about catching the wave and using it to our advantage. This talk will focus on where we go from here. We caught the wave; now what do we do to ensure that we don't get swallowed by it? What lessons can be learned from an election that featured the likes of fake news, Wiki leaks, rogue email servers, runaway tweets and showed in stark relief the divides that exist in our country. Computer science represents one of those divides. Given this and the fact that addressing the educational inequities prevalent in computer science was front and center in the CS for All announcement, what better time is there to renew our commitment to broadening participation in computing? As educators we have a powerful opportunity and responsibility in the wake of the blowback from the election-to educate, to listen, to remind ourselves constantly that we live in a very diverse country. We have no shortage of innovation in computer science, but who are we inspiring, what impact are those innovations having, and what can we do to learn from the lessons of the past to improve CS education? And above all, how do we respond to the challenges before us with empathy for those who are impacted by the decisions we make?", "authors": [{"name": "Gail Chapman", "affiliation": "Exploring Computer Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}], "tags": []}, {"title": "The Educator Identity and its Impact", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3025048", "abstract": "I'm going to address the educator identity from two perspectives. The first is my own perspective, where I will present what my educator identity means to me and what this has led me to devote time and energy on. My vision is that I want to be part of creating learning environments that benefit both the learner as an individual and society in general from many dimensions and purposes. As an educator I want to support our students on a route to become able and conscious graduates who will have a positive impact and be seen as truly professionally competent wherever their career takes them. This sounds hunky-dory, but how can it be achieved? I don't think there are any silver bullets that will lead to such a setting, but I do believe that knowing more is a way forward. Having no clear way forward was frustrating and this is where involvement in educator communities, like the SIGCSE community, became essential. Giving time and effort to such communities is, in my opinion, rewarding itself manyfold, not least, in my case, for aiding to understand the issues and opportunities involved in pursuing my vision. Developing my identity as educator through being part of the SIGCSE community, with its abundance of role models, has been invaluable for me. I hope my work will be an inspiration for others. Computing and engineering education research is the other big part in my strive for fulfilling my educator dreams. Or should I say pipe dreams as in the title of my thesis \"Developing and Assessing Professional Competencies: a Pipe Dream? Experiences from an Open-Ended Group Project Learning Environment\", which I defended on the day thirty years after I enrolled as a PhD student? No, I don't see it as a pipe dream even though there are much more to look into and understand regarding education in our field. This research area is the second perspective I want to bring up regarding educator identity, and I will use the research lens to look at the impact we as educators have on our students. My focus will be on the influence educators have on students learning with regard to aspects beyond pure computing skills. I will in the presentation build on work in our research group (UpCERG), which lately has included studying issues related to identity, both students and educators. I especially want to draw attention to the potential impact we as educators have on the \"gap\" between graduating truly professionally competent persons and merely technically competent persons.", "authors": [{"name": "Mats Daniels", "affiliation": "Uppsala University, Uppsala , Sweden"}], "tags": ["educators", "community", "identity", "research", "learning environments"]}, {"title": "Fulfilling Papert's Dream: Computational Fluency for All", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3025046", "abstract": "Fifty years ago, Seymour Papert and colleagues developed Logo as the first programming language for children.

How do we represent uncertainty in our computational models? Probabilities. Thus, we need to make sure that every computer science student learns probability and statistics. Data science, where data drives discovery and decision-making in all fields of study, underscores the importance of having a command of probability and statistics. At the heart of data science is data analytics whose methods such as machine learning rely on probabilistic and statistical reasoning. And since data serve as the currency of any data analytics workflow, explicit representation of probability distributions can help us calculate the degrees of uncertainty throughout a flow.

In this work, we explore the gender gap in CS at Rutgers University using three data sets that span thousands of students across 3.5 academic years. By combining these data sets, we can explore interesting issues such as retention, as students progress through the CS major. For example, we find that a large percentage of women taking the Introductory CS1 course for majors do not intend to major in CS, which contributes to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after CS1. This finding implies that a large part of the retention task is attracting these women to further explore the major.

SAFE is based on a BYOD (bring your own device) model that leverages student smart-phones to conduct auto-graded, cheating-free exams in a proctored class room setting. SAFE has 3 components: a smart-phone app, a web server and WiFi infrastructure to enable app-server communication. SAFE support a rich set of features to handle various types of questions as well as instructor preferences. In the design of SAFE, we set to achieve 4 goals: easy setup, cheating-free operation, robustness and scale. Easy setup is achieved predominantly due to the BYOD model and online mode of exams. Cheating is prevented via locking the app for the intended purpose along with reporting to the server any user attempts at cheating. Robustness is handled via periodic syncing of messages and careful consideration of corner cases. Scale is handled by carefully tuning the WiFi as well as via application level scheduling.\nSAFE has been used so far to conduct 90+ in-class quizzes in 9 courses in the last year. It was also used to conduct a high stake admission test for a Master's program in Computer Science. The feedback from end-users has been very positive and we continue to get new requests for trials in other courses.

One major challenge in offering courses in Big Data and Cloud Computing is resources. The question is how to provide students with authentic experiences making use of current Cloud and Big Data resources and tools and do so in a cost effective manner. Historically, three options, namely physical clusters, virtual clusters and cloud-based clusters, have been used to support Big Data and Cloud Computing courses. Virtual clusters and cloud-based options are those that institutions have typically adopted and many arguments in favor of these options exist in the literature, citing cost and performance. Here we argue that teaching Big Data and Cloud Computing courses can be done making use of a physical cluster and that many of the existing arguments fail to take into account many important factors in their calculations. These factors include the flexibility and control of a physical cluster in responding to changes in industry, the ability to work with much larger datasets, and the synergy and broad applicability of an appropriately equipped physical cluster for courses such as Cloud Computing, Big Data and Data Mining. We present three possible configurations of a physical cluster which span the spectrum in terms of cost and provide cost comparisons of these configurations against virtual and cloud-based options, taking into account the unique requirements of an academic setting.

Our early predictor analysis accurately detects 81% of the students who struggle throughout the course. However, our early predictor also captures transient struggling, as 43% of the students who ultimately did well in the course were classified as at-risk. In order to better differentiate sustained versus transient struggling, we further propose a trajectory metric which measures changes in programming behaviour. The trajectory metric detects 70% of the students who exhibit sustained struggling, and mis-classifies only 11% of students who go on to succeed in the course.

A four-year impact study found that a flipped classroom model combined with peer learning methods was superior to traditional lectures and labs for improving student performance and reducing attrition. Comparisons of pre- and post-class surveys revealed an improved perception of computing and an increased interest in the subject -- a positive outcome for a required introductory course. The author also studied the course's long-term effects. Three years after taking the course, a majority of students felt they retained what they learned and that learning computational thinking helped them to learn new software and perform better in advanced computing courses.

In this study, we extended the examination of CCEs to by deploying revised CCEs across two lower division (freshmen, sophomore) and three upper division (junior, senior) CS courses. We found a linear \"dosage effect\" of increasingly higher grades and computational thinking/CS knowledge test scores with completion of each additional CCE. This dosage effect was consistent across lower and upper division courses. Findings supported our contention that the merger of computational and creative thinking can be realized in computational creativity exercises that can be implemented and lead to increased student learning across courses from freshmen to senior level.

In particular, a specialized ISA based on the Progressive Learning Platform (PLP) is implemented in the computer architecture course. Prior research has demonstrated the benefits of using PLP in the computer engineering curriculum. However, it is possible that the PLP ISA could hinder learning by requiring extra work for students to master it (extraneous load), if they have not had prior exposure to it. To investigate this, the current study implemented a quasi-experimental design with two groups (students knowledgeable with PLP from a previous course, and new users) and a pretest to determine differences in students' familiarity with the common terms in computer engineering, pre-requisite knowledge for a computer architecture course, and course knowledge. Both sets of students implemented the PLP CPU in behavioral Verilog in the computer architecture course. Results of the evaluations revealed significant learning from pretest to posttest by students in both groups on all measures. Moreover, no group differences were seen, indicating that pre exposure to an ISA (specifically PLP ISA) might not be necessary for successful course implementation. This is promising, considering that many students at 4-year colleges in the USA transfer from other institutions, and may have exposure to different instruction set architectures in their prerequisite courses.

Over 240 classroom teachers attended CSPdWeek, making this professional development the single largest cross-curricular effort in preparing U.S. teachers to teach computing as part of the \"CS for All\" movement. This panel will focus on why this year's CSPdWeek was such a success and what was behind social media testimonies from teachers who talked about being part of an educational movement.", "authors": [{"name": "Owen Astrachan", "affiliation": "Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"}, {"name": "Ed Campos", "affiliation": "Orosi High School, Orosi, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Tracy Camp", "affiliation": "Colorado School of the Mines, Golden, CO, USA"}, {"name": "Joanna Goode", "affiliation": "University of Oregon, Eugene, OR, USA"}, {"name": "Emmanuel Schanzer", "affiliation": "Bootstrap, Alexandria, VA, USA"}], "tags": ["professional development", "CS for all", "K-12 education"]}, {"title": "CC2020: A Vision on Computing Curricula", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3017690", "abstract": "This panel discusses the development of a global, futuristic computing overview curricular report called Computing Curricular 2020, also known as CC2020.

While faculty and graduate student instructional support does not necessarily increase with the number of students in our courses, the number of qualified undergraduate teaching assistants for introductory CS courses should scale with the number of students in our courses. With large courses, the significance of the UTAs' role in students' learning likely also increases.

UTAs have a major role in affecting climate in computer science courses.

Anecdotal evidence and certain theories of learning suggest the new approach should result in superior learning outcomes for students. We are seeking ideas, feedback, and collaborators interested in investigating this hypothesis and obtaining stronger evidence for it. To summarize, our central question is: how can we investigate whether students gain a superior grasp of computational and complexity theory when they are taught primarily using non-decision problems?", "authors": [{"name": "John MacCormick", "affiliation": "Dickinson College, Carlisle, PA, USA"}], "tags": ["decision problems", "theory course", "computability theory", "complexity theory"]}, {"title": "Developing Big Data Curriculum with Open Source Infrastructure (Abstract Only)", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022386", "abstract": "This lightning talk will focus on our experience of developing and managing large undergraduate and graduate Big Data courses.

Some of this infrastructure is cloud based, while others require students to create virtualized environment on their personal computers. Both types of resources are freely available, easy to setup, and provide students with enough computational power to run most academic tasks and projects.

In this research, Pre-K girls, as early as four years of age, were introduced to eight computer-related games and activities. The girls learned about algorithms, computer programming, circuits, and robots in a hands-on, exploratory environment. Age-appropriate surveys were conducted to compare the girls' affinity towards the computer-related activities before and after the study. The results of the study are encouraging as the girls demonstrated increased positive attitudes towards computer-based activities after participating in the study. In addition, the results of the study also demonstrated that the participating girls were able to successfully learn computing concepts at a young age. The presentation of the study will be accompanied by a hand-out including descriptions of the activities and associated equipment for those who would like to explore the topics independently. The presenters will also demonstrate a few of the more portable activities used in the study.", "authors": [{"name": "Jean French", "affiliation": "Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC, USA"}, {"name": "Hailey Crouse", "affiliation": "Coastal Carolina University, Conway, SC, USA"}], "tags": ["pre-K", "gender", "stem", "computing", "girl", "female"]}, {"title": "Broadening Participation Research Project: Exploring Computing Careers through a Virtual Career Exploration Fair Using Embodied Conversational Agents (Abstract Only)", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022425", "abstract": "Research suggests that the African American population is continuously growing in America, yet African Americans are disproportionately represented when it comes to undergraduate and graduate degrees and careers in computing.

First, the descriptions of the games varied significantly based on the type of instruction, leading us to believe that teachers were taking more ownership of their creations. Second, the teachers who were taught with a guided discovery approach were able to work at a quicker pace, with less assistance, and ultimately were able to more quickly apply those skills to more complex games and simulations within the course of the professional development. Third, it also appears that this guided discovery teaching methodology is similarly impacting changes in pedagogy when these newly trained teachers use Scalable Game Design in the classroom.

We propose a unique model of inter-class student collaboration that motivates creativity, expands the scope of collaborative research and enables handling of conceptual gaps through inter-class peer mentoring. The proposed model engages students from an upper level class with students of a lower level class so that they can connect with each other in a peer mentor-mentee relationship to overcome conceptual gaps in learning. It provides upper level students with an exclusive opportunity to reinforce their conceptual grasps and engage in research for addressing the problems faced by lower level students. This proposed model of improvised peer collaboration promotes a new kind of service-oriented learning project in computing that inspires innovation and leads to research on finding ways to handle common conceptual limitations, thereby helping student retention by assisting lower level peer mentees. It also assists upper level peer mentors in self-driving towards research oriented thinking for inventing methods to solve authentic conceptual issues. The proposed model has been currently implemented in the UWGB computing curriculum, where CS2 students have been collaborating with CS1 students and have been participating in computing educational research as part of the process. These ongoing research experiments have analyzed the performance of the proposed model through data obtained by conducting student surveys. The collected survey data represent insightful evidences from preliminary evaluations of the proposed model.", "authors": [{"name": "Chelsea Patek", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, USA"}, {"name": "Ankur Chattopadhyay", "affiliation": "University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, USA"}], "tags": ["student-driven undergrad research", "conceptual gaps", "faculty-driven undergrad research", "peer mentee", "computing educational research", "innovation", "inter-class collaboration", "peer mentor"]}, {"title": "CodeBox64: A Tactile Input Modality for Block Programming (Abstract Only)", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022429", "abstract": "Many K-12 and university classrooms are now using block programming languages (e.g., Scratch, App Inventor, Code.org) to help students learn how to program. These block programming languages are popular because of their simplicity and \"tinkerability\" allowing novice users to create a project within minutes of first being exposed to the language. Unfortunately, these languages are highly dependent on the mouse and keyboard making them nearly inaccessible for those users with visual or motor impairments. This poster presents CodeBox64, a simplified input modality that is able to program block programming languages in a more tactile approach; it is a Tactile Input Modality (TIM). Because of the simplicity of CodeBox64, it allows visually impaired students to navigate the buttons and knobs with ease. CodeBox64 consists of four navigational buttons (i.e., up, down, left, right), a back button, and an enter button. It also contains an RFID sensor board that allows the user to use physical Lego blocks to execute commands of a block language. While CodeBox64 was originally developed to work with a custom, Blockly language, JamBlocks, it has the potential to work with other block languages. CodeBox64 demonstrates one possible methodology for enabling block languages to be accessible to those users with visual impairments.", "authors": [{"name": "Max Paulk", "affiliation": "Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA, USA"}, {"name": "Amber Wagner", "affiliation": "Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA, USA"}], "tags": ["accessible computing", "human computer interaction", "block programming"]}, {"title": "Broadening Secure Mobile Software Development (SMSD) Through Curriculum Development (Abstract Only)", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022438", "abstract": "In this poster we present an innovative authentic learning approach for Secure Mobile Software Development(SMSD) through real-world-scenario case studies.

It can be difficult to use course grades to connect student performance with learning outcomes for the course and the program. This poster presents an overview of an alternative approach to traditional grading: specifications grading. Specifications grading is a points-free, mastery style of grading that replaces partial credit with quality feedback and revision opportunity. This model provides several advantages over the traditional grading approach. These advantages include better support for high academic standards and rigor, an increased focus for students on learning by removing the intrinsic motivation to earn points, and a stronger connection between student grade assessments and course learning outcomes.

We developed a mailing list from the SIGCSE 16 attendees and will use that list to promote the BOF. The BOF will engage SIGCSE participants who have views on the content and role of courses and programs in data science. In addition to the workshop report, we will describe results from an NSF IUSE grant to develop modules for use in many types of courses. These expect to make access to fundamentals elements of data science available as widely as possible. With these as a starting point, participants in the Birds of a Feather session will explore the emerging field of data science and its relationship to computer science education.

Over the past few years, there has been a dramatic increase in CS undergraduate research activities at colleges and universities, and predominantly undergraduate institutions (PUIs) have an important role to play. Not every university has abundant resources to devote to research, and teaching-focused institutions may face the greatest challenges in this respect. Faculty at PUIs, for example, may face funding and infrastructure challenges and may find themselves stretched thin due to especially high teaching and service expectations. A frequently asked question by new faculty at these institutions is: Is it really possible to conduct meaningful research in such a fast-paced discipline as CS, while juggling a very high teaching and service load? Not only is the answer to this question \"Yes!\" but there are advantages to conducting research at a non-research institution. Faculty here has access to some of the brightest young minds who will potentially be future graduate students in research-intensive universities.

How successfully are programs engaging girls with different STEM orientations or different racial/ethnic/economic backgrounds? How successful are existing CS programs in pivoting to be more accessible to females? Many nonprofit organizations cannot effectively answer these questions because they lack the capacity for program evaluation. Some organizations delay putting evaluation into place, or use a one-dimensional evaluation approach (i.e., a single survey) even though ongoing and comprehensive evaluation results are crucial to program success. Building internal evaluation capacity can help organizations meet their most critical evaluation needs and build systems of continuous improvement.

Tools such as Scratch, Alice, and Kodu have been developed to engage students in learning to program through the creation of computational artifacts (e.g., games, animations, and stories). However, less is known about how elementary and middle school children reason about program behavior. Such skills are useful for reading and adapting others programs, locating possible sources of bugs, and predicting program behavior given code snippets (i.e., mental simulation). The goal of this poster is to measure and track the development of students' ability to reason about programs using Teague & Lister's Neo-Piagetian classification of novice programmers: Sensorimotor, Preoperational Thinkers, and Concrete Operational Thinkers. We operationalize Teague and Lister's category descriptions by creating a criterion for each category. This classification has helped us characterize students' mastery of strategies for reasoning about the lawful behavior of programs using a Kodu curriculum. In particular, this categorization was used to differentiate students' reasoning styles using data from two studies having 20 and 19 students each. We found strong consistency in the results across both studies. Through analysis and categorization of student responses, most students fall into the preoperational thinker category. Within this category, we found a diversity of mastery patterns that help us understand where students face challenges in reasoning about programs.", "authors": [{"name": "Ashish Aggarwal", "affiliation": "University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"}], "tags": ["kodu", "mental simulation", "computational thinking", "reasoning ability", "lawfulness", "neo-piagetian", "K-12"]}, {"title": "Managing the Internet of Things", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022452", "abstract": "The number of devices connected to the Internet has increased dramatically in recent years, driven in large part by a new movement called the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT). With the IoT, new applications for Internet connectivity have emerged beyond just laptops and smartphones, to unite a heterogeneous collection of connecting points tied to various aspects of daily life (e.g., Internet-enabled appliances, vehicles and wearable computing devices). As more devices are added to the Internet each day, controlling their interaction has become very challenging. The goal of this project is to create a software solution that will manage connected devices and allow users to specify the meaning of the device interactions. To achieve this, we are currently creating an Internet of Things platform, Wendo, to handle device connections, and a website to manage these devices. The platform is hardware agnostic allowing users to run the software on their own devices that support the communication standards they need. Additionally, Wendo can be extended easily to support new communication standards as they are released. To allow non-programmers to take advantage of our platform, we created ThingScript, a simple domain-specific language that has an English-like syntax that can be adopted by end-users to define the relationship between devices. We determine what actions can be performed on a device by requiring a thing definition file (.tdef). This file includes information about the actions, events and public data of each device.", "authors": [{"name": "Benjamin Romano", "affiliation": "The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"}], "tags": ["device interactions", "IoT platform", "internet of things"]}, {"title": "Sniffing Through Millions of Blocks for Bad Smells", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022450", "abstract": "Code smells codify poor coding patterns known to degrade software quality. Block-based languages have proven to be a viable educational and end-user programming paradigm with increasing adoption across a broad spectrum of users and domains. This rising popularity of this programming paradigm calls for a serious look at the program quality written in block-based languages. While code smells in the context of text-based languages have been studied extensively, the research community lacks a comprehensive understanding of code smells in block-based software. To address this problem, we present the results of a large-scale study of code smells prevalent in programs written in the highly popular Scratch programming language. We analyzed programs submitted to the public Scratch repository in 2016, considering a million programs altogether. We discovered interesting relationships between the prevalence of certain smells and the levels of proficiency of the programmers commonly introducing them. Our findings not only can help block-based programmers improve the quality of their software, but also establish the requirements for refactoring support in this programming domain.", "authors": [{"name": "Peeratham Techapalokul", "affiliation": "Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA"}], "tags": ["introductory computing", "CS education", "code smells", "block-based programming", "software quality", "scratch"]}, {"title": "Scaling Up Automated Verification: A Case Study and Formal-IDE for the Construction of High Integrity Software", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3017680.3022456", "abstract": "This work aims to show through a detailed case study that scaling up automated verification to larger non-trivial data structures is not only possible, but when combined with appropriate tool support, can be made more comprehensible and practicable to users in a variety of settings, including the undergraduate curriculum. The study involves an interplay of multiple components annotated with formal interface contracts and the components are all designed to be modular, reusable, and amenable to automated verification and analysis.
