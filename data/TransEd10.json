[{"title": "Integrating Asynchronous Digital Design Into the Computer Engineering Curriculum", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5233837/", "abstract": "As demand increases for circuits with higher performance, higher complexity, and decreased feature size, asynchronous (clockless) paradigms will become more widely used in the semiconductor industry, as evidenced by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors' (ITRS) prediction of a likely shift from synchronous to asynchronous design styles in order to increase circuit robustness, decrease power, and alleviate many clock-related issues , . ITRS shows that asynchronous circuits accounted for 11% of chip area in 2008, compared to 7% in 2007, and estimates they will account for 23% of chip area by 2014 and 35% of chip area by 2019 . To meet this growing industry need, computer engineering students should be introduced to asynchronous circuit design to make them more marketable and more prepared for the challenges faced by the digital design community for years to come. This paper introduces asynchronous logic design in the context of the familiar synchronous logic, then provides a description of course modules developed for NULL Convention Logic (NCL), an asynchronous logic paradigm that is very similar to the synchronous paradigm. This approach ensures that students can easily relate asynchronous design and optimization techniques to the corresponding synchronous techniques. The materials presented in this paper have been used in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses and have been well received by the students.", "authors": [{"name": "Waleed K.

Today, distance education represents an effective way for supporting and sometimes substituting the traditional formative processes, thanks to the technological improvements achieved in the field in recent years. However, the role of technology has often been overestimated. The amount of information students can obtain from the Internet is huge, and as a result, they can easily be confused. Teachers can also be disconcerted by this vast quantity of content and are often unable to suggest the correct content to their students. In the open scientific literature, it is widely recognized that an important factor for success in delivering learning content is related to the capability for customizing the learning process for the specific needs of a given learner. This task is still far from having been fully accomplished, and there is a real interest in investigating new approaches and tools to adapt the formative process to specific individual needs. In this scenario, the introduction of ontology formalism can improve the quality of the formative process, allowing the introduction of new and effective services. Ontologies can lead to important improvements in the definition of a course's knowledge domain, in the generation of an adapted learning path, and in the assessment phase. This paper provides an initial discussion of the role of ontologies in the context of e-learning. The improvements related to the introduction of ontologies formalism in the e-learning field are discussed, and a novel algorithm for ontology building through the use of Bayesian networks is shown.

Moreover, the necessary instrumentation is generally confusing to use, which reduces the motivation of the students.

Unfortunately, a phenomenon observed in today's high schools is a clear diminution of student interest in physics, leading to dwindling physics class sizes compared to a decade ago. The lack of interest in and passion for physics at the high school level ultimately leads to smaller intakes at the university level for electronics engineering courses and/or lower qualification cutoffs for students entering the programs.

This manipulator serves as part of the laboratory equipment used by students enrolled in courses in the Departments of Mechatronics and Industrial Engineering. The manipulator was created to enable students to gain practical knowledge of the integration of diverse engineering fields, including electro-pneumatics, sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers (PLC), field bus systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, material handling, industrial engineering, and intelligent control systems. The manipulator MRA-M01 is a three-degrees-of-freedom manipulator, with three linear actuators. Two of those are pneumatic (one controlled in a standard way by a control valve, and the other using servo-pneumatics), and one is electromechanical (with a dc motor). This manipulator supports hands-on activities in class by assisting students in material-handling tasks, which involve them learning about the structure of the manipulator and its components. Through this learning process, students are able to evaluate the use of different methods of manipulator design.

The Scottish education system is used for a case study in which a range of pilot high schools worked in close partnership with two university engineering departments. The study focuses on electronic/electrical engineering (EEE), a technically challenging area, which reflects many of the problems that are intrinsic to modern society. In so doing, the work also sought to support and refine the transition from the school environment to higher education engineering courses. EtF is founded on research into transformational change and describes the findings of a three-year program that sought to develop sustainable and transferable means of encouraging school students to study engineering at university. The authors describe the conditions needed to support sustainable developments. They also provide an analysis of inevitable constraints and suggest strategies to address these issues. The paper concludes that sustainable long-term promotion of engineering within schools to support the transition to university is possible if certain conditions are fulfilled. These conditions include the use of a model that facilitates partnerships among researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners in all sectors.

The activities developed can be used in combination for a very wide range of audiences in both age and stage of education, as has been demonstrated with great success. Moreover, the project has developed cross-disciplinary activities designed to engage nonscientiflc audiences and has used entirely nonscientific venues, such as art galleries. The suite of activities, given the umbrella title Chips for Everyone, includes: Chips for Everyone: drop-in activities for fairs, shows, shopping centers; Chips with Relish: interactive workshops for groups of school pupils; Chips with Flair: an arts-science collaboration in music, art, video, and engineering to present a new perspective on semiconductor technology. To achieve this diverse mix of outreach activities, the Chips for Everyone team represents a very broad spectrum of skills, its members being engineering academics, musicians, artists, education academics, public engagement specialists, and student teachers in technology. The development process is quite generic and could be applied in other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas. The subject focus of the project is semiconductor technology, a technology that influences the daily lives of everyone and yet is largely invisible. The activities seek to engage, engender interest, and promote informed discussion about this technology and engineering in general. From modest beginnings as a filler during the setting up of another outreach program, Chips for Everyone has developed into a major program reaching over 25 000 young people and families in school workshops, shopping centers, and art exhibitions in Scotland and across the U.K. The development method for the activities is innovative and creative, using the complimentary skills of research academics and students in both electronic engineering and technology initial teacher education (ITE).", "authors": [{"name": "Jane Magill", "affiliation": "Robert Clark Centre of Technological Education, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"}, {"name": "Scott Roy", "affiliation": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK"}], "tags": ["educational technology", "integrated circuit manufacture", "Semiconductor device modeling", "silicon chip fabrication", "Art", "Conferences", "Mobile handsets", "engineering academics", "initial teacher education", "outreach", "electrical engineering education", "semiconductor technology", "engineering", "semiconductor", "cross disciplinary activity", "integrated circuit design", "Educational institutions", "electronic engineering education", "Education", "electronic engineering", "Silicon", "educational aids", "electrical engineering outreach"]}, {"title": "Engaging Students in Applied Electromagnetics at the University of San Diego", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5272251/", "abstract": "Two possible topical approaches that have been applied to teaching an upper-division undergraduate electrical engineering applied electromagnetics course are presented.

It is safe to say that no single approach will work for all of the diverse ECE technologies and every type of learner. However, a few key innovations appear useful in keeping undergraduate students motivated to learn, resilient to technology evolution, and oriented amid the overload of new information and ECE applications. Engineering clinics, similar to their medical clinic counterparts, provide project-based experiences within the core of an ECE education that enable transformation of the entire curriculum toward an outcomes-oriented, student-centered, total-quality environment. Clinics and project-based learning approaches build skills that give the students confidence and motivation to continuously self-learn and adapt as the technologies around them give way to new, more effective paradigms. Perhaps more importantly, engineering clinic experiences provide numerous opportunities for students to experience the holism of true engineering problem-solving approaches and the ranges of potential technology solutions. This paper reviews the clinic innovations that will enable ECE education to become more effective in the midst of the present plethora of information and technology. Assessment results are provided and are very encouraging.
