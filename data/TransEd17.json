[{"title": "Teaching Business Management to Engineers: The Impact of Interactive Lectures", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7811278/", "abstract": "Some education specialists are challenging the use of traditional strategies in classrooms and are calling for the use of contemporary teaching and learning techniques. In response to these calls, many field experiments that compare different teaching and learning strategies have been conducted. However, to date, little is known on the outcomes of these strategies specific to the context of engineers and engineering education. The debate on traditional versus contemporary strategies continues, with many traditionalists holding firm to the view that contemporary techniques diminish the academic quality and integrity of teaching and learning. This paper adds to the current debate by assessing the outcome of interactive lectures, a contemporary teaching strategy, in the context of engineering education. Specifically, this paper examines the effect of interactive lectures on student academic achievement and the learning environment. This paper supported the quantitative survey responses with self-reported student reflections. The findings contradict the traditionalist view of teaching and learning; student performance was not significantly different when interactive learning strategies were employed. However, students held a more positive view toward the learning environment and felt that interactive learning enhanced their overall learning experiences and spurred interest in the subject area. This paper concluded that interactive lecturing can be an effective approach in teaching business management in engineering education.", "authors": [{"name": "Musti K. S.

The study involved a total of 71 students enrolled at three universities at two different stages of their studies. The development phases of the assessment device included an analysis of the competence and its facets, the design of the assessment task, the development of criteria to rate student performance, and the analysis of the basic psychometric properties for assessment methods in the area of education.

In this paper, data were examined from 112 students enrolled in four different academic years, during which changes were progressively incorporated to transform the traditional course to an open course. The results show an improvement in students' perceptions of resources and assessments and in their overall satisfaction. New assessment tools were developed and validated, without affecting the academic results.

At the college level, environmental context (classroom design, interactions with peers and role models, signals from stereotypical images) contribute to whether students will major in computing, whereas psychosocial factors (e.g., sense of belonging and self-efficacy) and departmental culture play a role in persistence in computing fields. As in other fields, issues associated with work-life conflict, occupational culture, and mentoring/networking opportunities play a role in women's participation in the computing workforce. Several initiatives and programs have been implemented to address women's underrepresentation in computing fields.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how students' interpretation of a task assigned during laboratory work may change during the task process, and how this relates to their conceptual understanding. A total of 143 students enrolled in an electronics course participated in this paper. Instruments to measure task interpretation and conceptual understanding were created, piloted, and applied before and after selected laboratory activities over the semester. Findings suggest that while students' task interpretation changes during the task process, increasing after the completion of the laboratory activity levels of task interpretation are low. Previous research findings-that students generally have an incomplete understanding of the assigned tasks and struggle to establish a connection between laboratory activities and the theory-were confirmed.

The experimental group (N = 19) used the SRec program visualization system, while the control group (N = 17) could use any programming tool in which they were proficient, such as BlueJ or Eclipse. The increase in motivation was measured by the difference between student scores in pre- and post-tests of their motivation.

This paper proposes a general four-step approach that can be used to establish a model for the intrinsic complexity of a problem class in terms of solving time. Such a model allows prediction of the time to solve new problems in the same class and helps instructors develop more reliable test problems. A complexity model, furthermore, enhances understanding of the problem and can point to new aspects interesting for education and research. Students can use complexity models to assess and improve their learning level. The approach is explained using the K-map minimization problem as a case study. The implications of this research for other problems in electrical and computer engineering education are highlighted. An important aim of this paper is to stimulate future research in this area. An ideal outcome of such research is to provide complexity models for many, or even all, relevant problem classes in various electrical and computer engineering courses.", "authors": [{"name": "Abdulhadi Shoufan", "affiliation": "Department of ECE, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"}], "tags": ["Regression analysis", "Boolean functions", "Minimization", "Boolean function minimization", "problem solving time", "test problem intrinsic complexity", "intrinsic complexity", "Reliability", "problem definition", "Complexity theory", "computational complexity", "regression", "K-map minimization problem", "minimisation", "complexity model", "problem solving", "student assessment", "computer engineering courses", "Problem-solving", "Indexes"]}, {"title": "Blending Communities and Team-Based Learning in a Programming Course", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7967733/", "abstract": "In recent years, engineering education teachers have needed to incorporate technology-supported collaboration to enhance learning. Implementing these activities requires course redesign, which must be meticulous for their full potential to be reached. This can require a lot of work for first time users, which can be a barrier to implementation. Educational design patterns alleviate this burden by facilitating new course design with practices demonstrated to promote student engagement. This paper reports on the redesign of an introductory programming course and its experimental evaluation. The redesign was based on the community of inquiry learning framework (CoL), using design patterns from online Web communities and team-based learning (TBL). The evaluation included 562 students, 117 of them randomly assigned to two different experimental groups. One group used a CoL approach, and the other a blended TBL and CoL methodology. The remaining students were assigned to control groups. Results showed that students in the experimental groups outperformed those in the control group by the end of the semester, while the experimental CoL and TBL methodology helped students achieve a higher level of understanding in a shorter period of time due to increased participation rates. These data provide empirical evidence of the learning gains offered by online learning communities, and the way in which educational design patterns can facilitate course redesign.", "authors": [{"name": "Jorge Villalon", "affiliation": "Faculty of Economy and Business, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile"}, {"name": "Jorge Chavez", "affiliation": "Faculty of Education, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile"}, {"name": "Ignacio Cabrera", "affiliation": "Faculty of Engineering and Science, Universidad Adolfo Ibanez, Penalolen, Chile"}], "tags": ["student engagement", "community of inquiry learning framework", "computer science education", "programming", "online learning communities", "educational courses", "blended TBL", "course redesign", "online Web communities", "Engineering education", "Teamwork", "Internet", "object-oriented methods", "Collaborative work", "introductory programming course", "Blended learning", "CoL approach", "computer aided instruction", "Programming profession", "team-based learning", "educational design patterns", "learning communities"]}, {"title": "The Effects of a Robot Game Environment on Computer Programming Education for Elementary School Students", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7742384/", "abstract": "In the past, computer programming was perceived as a task only carried out by computer scientists; in the 21st century, however, computer programming is viewed as a critical and necessary skill that everyone should learn. In order to improve teaching of problem-solving abilities in a computing environment, extensive research is being done on teaching-learning methods, types of teaching software, the educational environment, and related tools. This paper, based on diverse experimental results, proposes an environment where elementary students can easily learn and practice computer programming. The proposed robot game environment used a tangible programming tool with which students can easily create robot programs, without learning syntax, and then validate their programming results; it can also provide various game activities to incite students' interest. Observation of elementary school students placed in the robot game environment confirmed the tool's usability and entertainment aspects, and students' attitudes toward programming and their understanding of programming concepts improved.", "authors": [{"name": "Wongyu Lee", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"}, {"name": "Daiyoung Kwon", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science Education, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"}, {"name": "Jaekwoun Shim", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science Education, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"}], "tags": ["Computer engineering", "elementary school students", "teaching software", "educational environment", "computer science education", "computer programming education", "robot game environment effect", "Computers", "elementary school", "robot programming", "problem-solving ability", "tangible programming tool", "control engineering education", "teaching-learning methods", "Education", "Robot sensing systems", "Programming profession", "teaching", "games", "problem solving", "Games", "computer games"]}, {"title": "Teaching Game Theory to Improve Adversarial Thinking in Cybersecurity Students", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7809088/", "abstract": "The ability to anticipate the strategic actions of hackers, including where, when, and how they might attack, and their tactics for evading detection, is a valuable skill for cybersecurity. Therefore, developing the strategic reasoning abilities of cybersecurity students is an important cybersecurity education learning objective. This paper proposes that basic game theory concepts should be taught to cybersecurity students in order to improve their strategic reasoning abilities. It details a pretest-posttest educational experiment that demonstrates that 2 h of basic game theory instruction results in a statistically significant improvement in students' abilities to anticipate the strategic actions of others. It also provides details of the game theory curriculum to help other cybersecurity educators replicate these results. Additionally, this paper suggests that another benefit of teaching game theory in a cybersecurity course is that it may fundamentally alter the way students view the practice of cybersecurity, helping to sensitize them to the human adversary element inherent in cybersecurity in addition to technology-focused best practices. This could result in a more naturally strategic-minded, and therefore better equipped, cybersecurity workforce.", "authors": [{"name": "Seth T.

Free-choice learners can be engaged in a wide range of experiences, ranging from watching entertaining educational videos to actively participating in hands-on projects. Efforts in informal science learning are often gauged by their ability to elicit interaction, to foster learning, and to influence perceptions of STEM fields. This paper presents the installation of a biomimetic robotic fish controlled by an iDevice application at an informal science learning exhibit. Visitors to the exhibit are offered a unique experience that spans engineering and science, in which they can steer the robotic fish, choosing from three modes of control. Visitor engagement is examined through the lens of the Selinda model of visitor learning, while their behavior is examined using an adapted model of Borun's framework for behaviors indicative of learning. The evaluation of the efficacy of the exhibit is assessed through a post-experience survey questionnaire, an analysis of the application usage, and a behavior coding study. Data collected on visitor interactions with the exhibit indicate that free-choice learners value the importance of engineering research, and prefer interactive modes. Further, behavior coding results support the ability of the robotic fish platform to capture the visitors' attention. Findings offer compelling evidence that the exhibit is both highly engaging to visitors and a suitable format for science inquiry.", "authors": [{"name": "Maurizio Porfiri", "affiliation": "Education, and Human Development, New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, New York, NY, USA"}, {"name": "Paul Phamduy", "affiliation": "Education, and Human Development, New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, New York, NY, USA"}, {"name": "Catherine Milne", "affiliation": "Education, and Human Development, New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, New York, NY, USA"}, {"name": "Mary Leou", "affiliation": "Education, and Human Development, New York University Steinhardt School of Culture, New York, NY, USA"}], "tags": ["education robotics", "iDevice application", "Biologically-inspired robots", "engagement", "free-choice learning", "Encoding", "Selinda visitor learning model", "mobile robots", "educational robots", "biomimetic robotic fish", "STEM", "Tools", "informal learning", "control engineering education", "biomimetics", "informal science learning", "mobile applications", "interactive robotic fish exhibit", "mechanical engineering", "Fish", "Robot sensing systems", "exhibit"]}, {"title": "The Role of Gender in Students\u2019 Ratings of Teaching Quality in Computer Science and Environmental Engineering", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7918606/", "abstract": "Students' ratings of teaching quality on course units in a computer science program and an environmental engineering program at a large Swedish university were obtained using the Course Experience Questionnaire; 8888 sets of ratings were obtained from men and 4280 sets were obtained from women over ten academic years. These student ratings from the two programs showed certain differences; in particular, teachers tended to receive higher ratings in subjects that were less typical for their gender than in subjects that were more typical for their gender. There were differences in the ratings given to male and female teachers, differences in the ratings given by male and female students, and interactions between these two effects. There was no systematic trend for students to give different ratings to teachers of the same gender as themselves than to teachers of the other gender. Nevertheless, without exception, even the statistically significant effects were small in magnitude and unlikely to be of theoretical or practical importance. It is concluded that the causes of differences in the career progression of male and female teachers in engineering education need to be sought elsewhere.", "authors": [{"name": "Ingrid Svensson", "affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"}, {"name": "Jonas Borell", "affiliation": "Ergonomics and Aerosol Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"}, {"name": "Linda Price", "affiliation": "Technology Enhanced Learning, Kingston University, Kingston upon Thames, U.K."}, {"name": "John T.
