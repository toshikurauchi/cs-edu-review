The First-Year Seminar in Engineering at our University is offered once each year during the fall term. The enrollment can be between 45 and 50 first-year students. In recent years, the course, which is coordinated by one engineering faculty member and taught by up to fifteen different instructors, comprises a loosely organized collection of engineering and non-engineering topics delivered in twenty eight 55-minute sessions of the semester (14 weeks of instruction). The summative assessment of the student learning outcomes has revealed glaring weaknesses in content and delivery. For the incoming engineering student to receive both the holistic university experience and the ability to learn and retain fundamental engineering principles and practices, the course is being revised through central and integrative engineering design projects with service learning components. The revised structure places emphasis on the continuity across modules and sessions to ensure (a) the sustained engagement, and (b) the highest levels of student learning and retention of concepts throughout the semester.", "authors": [{"name": "Ramakrishnan Sundaram", "affiliation": "Gannon University"}], "tags": ["lead", "economics", "problem-solving", "seminars", "educational institutions", "materials"]}, {"title": "Set up and delivery of electrical and computer engineering projects at undergraduate engineering universities for outreach and partnership with K-12 STEM schools", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2011.6142697", "abstract": "This paper discusses the set up and delivery of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) projects with critical Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) components as part of \u201cEngage K-12 students in ECE\u201d, the outreach and partnership program to (a) inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in ECE disciplines, and (b) integrate K-12 STEM learning with the ECE disciplines at institutes of higher education.

The IEEE Student Branch at Haldia Institute of Technology has always attempted to put more emphasis on hands-on learning and training for fellow students through various workshops and training sessions. As a part of such activity, training sessions on basics of mobile robots are being conducted for the last 3 years. Participation has been from a wide range of backgrounds, from different streams and different undergraduate to post graduate levels. Initial aim of the workshop sessions was to motivate students in design, estimation, fabrication and testing their own ideas of basic mobile robots. During the course of events in last few years, as will be reported in the paper, several interesting findings could be identified. It is felt that in order to perform well in their workplace, as well as to be responsible citizens, students are required to not only develop mastery of a particular subject, but civic, social, interpersonal and workplace skills as well [1]. In addition to reinforcing concepts from earlier and concurrent courses, such workshops can serve as a platform for exposing students to inter-disciplinary topics that appear in greater depth in later courses. Also, students mature in areas such as oral and written communication, awareness of professional ethics issues, and working effectively in a team-based setting. Mixing of students from different disciplines and different grades greatly enhances sense of fellow feeling and team spirit. Such workshops, being conducted by students themselves, increases the sense of belongingness, inculcates maturity, sensibility, leadership qualities among the organizing students [2].", "authors": [{"name": "Tuhin S.

As disciplinary programs evolved from a general engineering program and the number of students was low, this was a difficult process under the old ABET Criteria; the new ABET Criteria gave opportunities to design unique programs. New curricula were developed in 1996 along with an assessment process that took into account the needs of constituencies. Since then, the programs, assessment processes, as well as the process of determining the needs of constituencies have evolved substantially. Ethics has evolved from half of a course shared with engineering economic to ethics throughout the curricula; engineering economics has evolved into a full course for the BSME program, and an engineering entrepreneurship course for the BSEE and BSCpE programs; a legal studies course is required in the BSEE and BSCpE curricula; an option in Mechatronics Systems Engineering has been added to the BSEE program; and 5 year dual degree programs have been created that combine BS and MS degrees.", "authors": [{"name": "Ronald R.

To address these questions, the following steps were taken. First, engineering faculty members who taught a sophomore statics and dynamics course at Texas A&M University were asked for problems involving first-year mathematics and physics mechanics they thought students should be able to solve entering the course. Learning outcomes were abstracted, and two instruments were developed and administered near the beginning of the statics and dynamics course.

Based on Dweck's research results we assume a growth mindset is a reasonable surrogate for a student engineer's creative and innovative or entrepreneurial skills. Mindsets of student engineers are benchmarked at the beginning of the freshman year and again at the end of the freshman year, soon after completion of a team based poverty alleviation freshman capstone project. Pre- and post- control samples of freshman engineer mindsets are being collected from similar sized engineering programs at comparable colleges in our geographic vicinity.

This allows more efficient use of computing resources, improving the revenue of the system and enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) received by users while minimizing the power consumption of the machines. Several research works conclude that in order to efficiently manage a cloud-based infrastructure (meaning, deploy computing resources when needed without affecting negatively to the QoS perceived by users), accurate predictions on the load of machines should be made. Thanks to this, resources can be ready to use when users need them, and shutdown when they are not needed - thus reducing the power consumption and enhancing the revenue of the system.

Preliminary data analysis shows that this particular program is well below the national average for nearly all underrepresented groups in engineering technology programs. The data does not indicate that a significant retention problem exists within this program; rather it is most likely an initial recruitment problem. Recognizing that some underrepresented groups are represented to an even lesser degree in engineering technology programs than in engineering programs may shed some light on this problem.
