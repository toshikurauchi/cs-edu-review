The First-Year Seminar in Engineering at our University is offered once each year during the fall term. The enrollment can be between 45 and 50 first-year students. In recent years, the course, which is coordinated by one engineering faculty member and taught by up to fifteen different instructors, comprises a loosely organized collection of engineering and non-engineering topics delivered in twenty eight 55-minute sessions of the semester (14 weeks of instruction). The summative assessment of the student learning outcomes has revealed glaring weaknesses in content and delivery. For the incoming engineering student to receive both the holistic university experience and the ability to learn and retain fundamental engineering principles and practices, the course is being revised through central and integrative engineering design projects with service learning components. The revised structure places emphasis on the continuity across modules and sessions to ensure (a) the sustained engagement, and (b) the highest levels of student learning and retention of concepts throughout the semester.", "authors": [{"name": "Ramakrishnan Sundaram", "affiliation": "Gannon University"}], "tags": ["economics", "materials", "seminars", "educational institutions", "lead", "problem-solving"]}, {"title": "Set up and delivery of electrical and computer engineering projects at undergraduate engineering universities for outreach and partnership with K-12 STEM schools", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2011.6142697", "abstract": "This paper discusses the set up and delivery of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) projects with critical Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) components as part of \u201cEngage K-12 students in ECE\u201d, the outreach and partnership program to (a) inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in ECE disciplines, and (b) integrate K-12 STEM learning with the ECE disciplines at institutes of higher education.

The IEEE Student Branch at Haldia Institute of Technology has always attempted to put more emphasis on hands-on learning and training for fellow students through various workshops and training sessions. As a part of such activity, training sessions on basics of mobile robots are being conducted for the last 3 years. Participation has been from a wide range of backgrounds, from different streams and different undergraduate to post graduate levels. Initial aim of the workshop sessions was to motivate students in design, estimation, fabrication and testing their own ideas of basic mobile robots. During the course of events in last few years, as will be reported in the paper, several interesting findings could be identified. It is felt that in order to perform well in their workplace, as well as to be responsible citizens, students are required to not only develop mastery of a particular subject, but civic, social, interpersonal and workplace skills as well [1]. In addition to reinforcing concepts from earlier and concurrent courses, such workshops can serve as a platform for exposing students to inter-disciplinary topics that appear in greater depth in later courses. Also, students mature in areas such as oral and written communication, awareness of professional ethics issues, and working effectively in a team-based setting. Mixing of students from different disciplines and different grades greatly enhances sense of fellow feeling and team spirit. Such workshops, being conducted by students themselves, increases the sense of belongingness, inculcates maturity, sensibility, leadership qualities among the organizing students [2].", "authors": [{"name": "Tuhin S.

As disciplinary programs evolved from a general engineering program and the number of students was low, this was a difficult process under the old ABET Criteria; the new ABET Criteria gave opportunities to design unique programs. New curricula were developed in 1996 along with an assessment process that took into account the needs of constituencies. Since then, the programs, assessment processes, as well as the process of determining the needs of constituencies have evolved substantially. Ethics has evolved from half of a course shared with engineering economic to ethics throughout the curricula; engineering economics has evolved into a full course for the BSME program, and an engineering entrepreneurship course for the BSEE and BSCpE programs; a legal studies course is required in the BSEE and BSCpE curricula; an option in Mechatronics Systems Engineering has been added to the BSEE program; and 5 year dual degree programs have been created that combine BS and MS degrees.", "authors": [{"name": "Ronald R.

To address these questions, the following steps were taken. First, engineering faculty members who taught a sophomore statics and dynamics course at Texas A&M University were asked for problems involving first-year mathematics and physics mechanics they thought students should be able to solve entering the course. Learning outcomes were abstracted, and two instruments were developed and administered near the beginning of the statics and dynamics course.

Based on Dweck's research results we assume a growth mindset is a reasonable surrogate for a student engineer's creative and innovative or entrepreneurial skills. Mindsets of student engineers are benchmarked at the beginning of the freshman year and again at the end of the freshman year, soon after completion of a team based poverty alleviation freshman capstone project.

Several research works conclude that in order to efficiently manage a cloud-based infrastructure (meaning, deploy computing resources when needed without affecting negatively to the QoS perceived by users), accurate predictions on the load of machines should be made. Thanks to this, resources can be ready to use when users need them, and shutdown when they are not needed - thus reducing the power consumption and enhancing the revenue of the system.

Analyzing the academic success of engineering students, previous research [2] shows that even high-performance students after four years of college instruction still continue to hold significant misconceptions about scientific concepts and have incorrect interpretations of phenomena (like electricity, force, light). This paper is based on the dissertation research that focuses on the analysis of students' misconceptions about electricity. It represents a unique synthesis of methods from educational research and cognitive psychology applied to the population of Electrical Engineering Technology students. Misconceptions about electrical concepts of freshmen will be analyzed and compared to the misconceptions of seniors. The goals of this research target: (1) understanding how student mental models and misconceptions change with increasing levels of competency and expertise during their progression from freshmen to senior levels and (2) investigating the correlation between student academic success and their misconceptions.", "authors": [{"name": "Tatiana V.

We found that student drafts changed an average of 105.4% from draft 1 to 2, and 43.8% from draft 2 to 3. Of this change, we can attribute all but 37.7% of the change from draft 1 to 2 to increased length, and all but 23.6% of the change from draft 2 to 3 to increased submission length.

This paper reports on a technique that requires students to complete a series of laboratory exercises designed to give them an operational awareness of the technical issues associated with small wind turbines. The three main efforts required of students were characterizing the efficiency of small generators, characterizing the efficiency of different wind turbine designs, and determining the charging characteristics of lead-acid batteries. This technique has been found to be much more effective than classroom-style instruction or pure literature review, most likely because it appeals to active, visual, and sequential learning styles.

Increased numbers of writing intensive courses, refinements to document requirements and proliferation of rubric development indicate the effort used to address the elevated priority. The sharing of rubrics and standards for the formatting and content of various report styles is intended to help students understand the writing assessment process. While sharing reduces the \u201cwe can't read your mind\u201d comments associated with qualitatively assessed assignments, it does not always improve the outcome, since it does not provide a \u201clearn by example\u201d experience. Consequently, the first two or three reports submitted are typically of low quality, and many receive failing grades. In an effort to significantly improve student performance on early semester reports, a critique-based exercise has been inserted early in a junior level laboratory class. Students are randomly assigned previously graded student reports which have been stripped of identifying information to protect the original authors. The reports were previously evaluated using a rubric which included both qualitative assessment information and guidelines for assigning point deductions. The students were instructed to evaluate the sample reports guided by the rubrics and standards for formatting and content. The deliverable for the critique assignment included assessing a numerical \u201cgrade\u201d for their report sample, along with justifications for the assessments. Initial results indicated an average increase in the quality of the initial report submissions when compared to initial reports from three previous years.

To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, we apply it to the content of a first-year engineering textbook. Our analysis reveals significant gaps between the textbook's coverage of electric circuit theory and recent advances in engineering education research, which provide many insights about effective teaching and learning techniques based on a conceptual understanding approach.

The pre-intervention survey provided an insight into the students' initial disorientation in starting the projects but also acted as an awareness mechanism for the student participants to consolidate or improve their literature review skills. A series of intervention workshops were devised based on the pre-intervention survey. A post-intervention survey was then conducted along with a focus group. The paper discusses the results of these two surveys and then compares them with the `actual' literature review skills demonstrated in progress reports (contain the literature review section). From the pre and post intervention surveys, it can be seen that the intervention workshops were successful in increasing awareness and understanding of the literature reviews. However, the intervention was regarded as not so successful if the knowledge of literature reviews was based on the progress report artifacts. This is somewhat a contradiction. The literature review skills demonstrated in their final dissertations were compared with those in their progress reports.

The analysis provided a wide spectrum of perspectives on leadership however there were strong themes that suggest there is a linkage between authority and leadership. There is a belief that the type and the degree of leadership required are different for professional practice versus academia. There are also strong themes that leadership is heavily influenced by natural traits (nature), but interestingly, by learnable skills and behaviors (nurture), and very much dependent on the actual environment (context).

Non-technical courses have always been considered better suited to addressing Information Literacy skills. Commonly, assessment in these types of programs consists of written essays, analysing case studies, and report writing; assessment which is generally more applicable to the implicit embedding of Information Literacy skills. Technical courses, generally, rely more heavily on mathematical computations and technical descriptions and drawings to demonstrate knowledge and information and are proving to be more challenging to effectively embed Information Literacy as a learning outcome.

We start by discussing freshmen's CS dominant conceptions, and the role they think it plays for their future career. We then give some statistical elements concerning student perception of such a course; in particular, we analyze the obtained feedbacks and the limits of intended learning outcomes. In the light of this analysis, it is possible to state that, although initially reluctant to CS due to misconceptions, some students can develop interest and expectancy for this discipline as applied to engineering.

The activity sequence and learning resources are rigidly defined during authoring. This fact makes difficult to react to unexpected events that may happen in live courses. Also, this rigidness does not allow instructors to give \"their personal touch\" to courses. This paper presents the improvements made on GRAIL - an IMS LD compliant player-aimed at the support of a flexible enactment phase. Two types of modifications are considered: the modification of the learning flow and the management of course content with a wiki engine.

Many women manage the conflict by hiding or denying their feminine identity. We found that this strategy becomes particularly evident when discussing experiences of sexism. Focus groups with women graduate students identified many instances of sexism, but found that women tended to deny or ignore the sexism. Because sexism communicates the view that women do not fit in the culture of computing, it increases the difficulty of combining a feminine gender identity with a technical identity. Many women try to meet this challenge by minimizing their femininity, or acting like one of the guys. These coping strategies may be effective for enabling individual persistence, but they permit persistence of an inhospitable environment.

Technology has altered both the way we teach and learn. Students today are cited as being no less inherently intelligent than their peers of the past but as being much less focused and much less capable of the inductive thinking required for innovation. The attitude has shifted from needing to understand the basics to relying on technological resources to provide the answers. The result is students who are able to solve problems more efficiently than 30 years ago but who lack the understanding necessary to distinguish between reasonable and unreasonable findings. While faculty are finding fault in the unfocused student, students feel neglected by the faculty. As university priorities shift from education to innovation in pursuit of research funding, students suffer from inattentive professors. Between running a quality laboratory, applying for grants, and publishing papers, faculty have little time left to devote to the other portion of their job - teaching. This lack of time results in uninteresting lectures, unattended office hours, and a growing gap between students and instructors.

Two required introductory engineering courses, Physics Laboratory and Engineering Design, are investigated. The ensuing theoretical framework is placed in the broader context of Eccles and Wigfield's expectancy-value model, specifically focusing on utility value. Our findings indicate that students' perceptions of the skills and knowledge required in professional engineering diverge from those defined by ABET.

A bottom-up approach to computer architecture and programming was implemented in an experimental course at Purdue University and was offered to first year students. A study of that course's effectiveness is currently underway using a mixed-methods study. The Concurrency Concepts Inventory, an objective examination, and a focus group of past students will be the primary methods of evaluation. A pilot focus group was held in order to design a survey that accurately reflects students' understanding of the topics in question using concept maps and other methods. Initial findings using the Concurrency Concepts Inventory suggest that parallelism can certainly be grasped by first year students, and also show a small negative correlation between a student taking a traditional course in computer programming and that student's understanding of parallelism concepts.

This study investigates the knowledge gap that non-computing major college students (n=126) possess about computational thinking in an introductory MS Excel course by measuring their performance using spreadsheet functions in three categories: recall, application, and problem solving. The empirical result, analyzed using ANOVA, shows that students can recall the meaning of those functions but seem to have trouble using them correctly and precisely (cued or uncued). Students' test results suggest the following issues: (1) problems with understanding the data type, (2) failure in translating problems to productive representations using spreadsheet functions, and (3) inadequate stipulation of the computational representations in precise forms.

Both potential employers and accrediting agencies, such as ABET, expect students to gain proficiency in teamwork skills through experiential learning. Teamwork based projects challenge the student to apply the technical knowledge they gain in school to solve meaningful and complex problems. However, to be truly proficient in teamwork, a student must also learn and practice a large number of peripheral skills. These include planning, estimating, tracking progress, taking corrective actions, managing change, controlling and managing risks, maintaining ethical and professional conduct, communicating complex ideas clearly and concisely, using design automation tools, leveraging web-based tools for team collaboration, and most importantly participating effectively as team members. It is essential that students should be taught these important skills. It is unlikely that without adequate faculty guidance students can pick up these skills through ad-hoc project experience. Yet, many engineering and computer science programs expect the students to do just that. We feel strongly that we need to employ a more pragmatic approach in teaching students the skills necessary to function as effective and productive team members. Additionally, we need to develop criteria for assessing the effectiveness of teaching teamwork and the tools to measure learning outcomes. Among the problems contributing to this situation are the following: engineering and computer science instructors themselves often have had little or no experience operating in teams; training or guidance in effective ways to teach teamwork is seldom provided; and tools and effective approaches to assist in the teaching and assessment of teamwork are lacking. Another problem is that, it takes a great deal of faculty time, effort and energy to guide groups of students in doing effective teamwork. We will describe an approach that we have used to teach team collaboration skills using free and freely available web-based tools. Students learn to use tools for design automation, metrics collection, project management, and web-based collaboration. Our approach encourages students to learn teamwork skills and improves levels of collaboration among team members while reducing demands on faculty time and effort. Use of web-based collaboration tools allows students to participate without the need for frequent face-to-face meetings; this our students love. In an effort to maximize the use of techniques like the ones described in this paper, we hold regular informal sessions of interested faculty to share ideas on improving teaching teamwork and to develop methods and tools for assessment.

In this context, a large scale of educational institutions face challenges on how to specify the desired educational goals for a specific discipline and on how to instantiate and evaluate their program-specific designs according to these goals. We have defined a curricula design model for designing, redesigning, and evaluating systems and computing engineering (S&C) programs. The core of this model is the orientation to projects for the definition of educational goals that facilitate the definition of courses that integrate a set of these desired goals.

Each generation of engineers has used that part of mechanics of materials theory that fit the calculating capability available to them. The method presented here is offered in that vein. The method uses an engineer's ability to construct free body diagrams, derive moment equations, and knowledge of energy methods. The problem solution is kept general until the last step which is a digital numerical integration. The digital numerical integration can be performed on a wide variety of software to include TKSolver\u2122, MatLab\u00ae, MathCad\u00ae, EES\u00ae and spread sheets. This method keeps the section properties independent of the moment equations making it straightforward to include scaling and shape factors on the cross-sectional dimensions. This allows an engineer to run any number of \"what if\" scenarios during a design process. Additionally, this method provides intermediate opportunities to validate the solution path by a) plotting the moment equation and comparing it against shear and moment diagram developed by hand, or b) plotting the cross section and comparing it against the drawings.

While there are various factors leading to these outcomes, the pressure of grades early in an engineering program can be a significant contributor. GPA is typically used to determine a student's academic success, but the reality is that the student often needs time to learn how to earn and keep good grades in college before they accurately reflect the student's performance and potential. Considering this, Colorado State University recently offered an option for incoming engineering students to take all of their first-semester classes as pass/fail. For the fall semester of 2010, 138 of 448 first-year students enrolled in the pass/fail option.

By providing students with a fine-grained marking scheme - the milestones - at the start of semester, and allowing students to claim these marks at any point in the semester, students can better plan and self-manage their learning. The milestone-based assessment approach is intended to motivate the students by making the assessment process transparent and accessible. To determine whether or not this has occurred, it is necessary to evaluate the initiative through the lens of motivation theories. Since the connection between motivation and learning is well understood, looking specifically at motivation should shed light on how deeply students are learning in this new approach. In this paper, student data from three semesters of implementation is reviewed and explained using various motivation theories: Self-Determination Theory, Flow Theory, Self-Efficacy Theory, Goal Theory, and Expectancy-Value Theory.

Such methods tend to place a greater emphasis on the outcome (or product) of teaming rather than on the process of teaming itself. The use of standalone peer-evaluations to indirectly determine team effectiveness has also been shown to be problematic, since students are not typically taught how to properly evaluate their peers.

Most common simulators in the literature are visually attractive, but are often designed to solve a particular or limited problem. Authoring tools have the advantage to allow building several learning environments, involving professors without computer expertise. Therefore, teachers require less effort and time to develop simulation problems. In this work we present an on line authoring simulation tool, called AuthorPhysics, aimed to facilitate the design of physics active learning problems, reducing instructors' time and effort.

The mathematics assessment instruments were designed to provide a means for suggesting corrective measures for students to take to improve performance in mathematics, and it was demonstrated that these measures also have an impact on performance in physics.

Further, Tablet PCs facilitate better interaction with persons participating in classroom sessions from remote locations since they easily involve students exchanging visual descriptions of concepts with the instructor and the rest of the class. Several software packages are available to support the pedagogical needs of the university classroom as well as typical group collaborative environments. Classroom Presenter, DyKnow, WriteOn and MS OneNote with the Interactive Classroom add-in are examples of some of the packages that provide excellent classroom capabilities. These packages allow for a highly interactive environment with both teacher-student and student-student bi-direction real-time interaction. See www.ee.vt.edu/\u223cjgtront/tabletpc/ to download tablet PC software. In this hands-on tutorial faculty will receive an introduction to the use of Classroom Presenter, OneNote, Interactive Classroom, VectorPad, and PDF Annotator. We will provide sufficient instruction for faculty to have a basic competency with the technology. Most importantly, we will show faculty various pedagogical practices that we have found helpful in using these technology tools in the classroom over the past seven years. Active learning exercises for various disciplines will be emphasized. Faculty will be tasked with developing short active learning exercises starting from the development of goals for the exercise, through the desired student interaction, and ending with the exercise assessment and improvement strategy. These active learning exercises will be targeted to students who are expected to be in the classroom as well as those who may be taking the course at extended campus locations. Exercises will be determined by the individual faculty member's disciplinary interests.", "authors": [{"name": "Joseph G.

Where do you go to find these digital learning materials? How do you evaluate the quality of the materials you do find? Are there digital learning materials available that are aligned with the ABET criteria? Are there related resources for assessing student outcome assessments that you can use? How can you customize your course website with supplemental materials for students? How can you find a collection of self-studies that can be used to guide a department as they prepare for the ABET review process? This workshop introduces faculty who are interested in integrating digital learning materials in their courses to a set of criteria and methods useful in selecting and evaluating the quality of these materials to help achieve their course goals. The workshop focuses on the 10,000 educational resources cataloged in the Engineering Pathway digital library (www.engineeringpathway.org) and goes through the resources and tools available for faculty to use to locate, evaluate and select helpful digital learning materials to achieve their teaching and learning goals. Participants will be introduced to a general intellectual framework for integrating digital learning materials that stresses identifying the particular learning objectives and pedagogies for the use of particular materials. Participants will be introduced to two sets of evaluation criteria, those used in the Premier Award for Excellence in Engineering Education Courseware and another set that is used to guide catalogers as they register materials in a digital library. They will have a hands-on opportunity to apply these criteria to better understand the metrics for quality in digital learning materials, and how to apply these metrics to materials they are considering using to help achieve their course goals. The workshop also helps faculty locate courseware that can help satisfy the ABET criteria for evaluation. For those preparing for the ABET review process, the Engineering Pathway identifies a number of self-study that can be used to guide departments in the development of measurement instruments and processes. Lastly, the workshop will introduce new tools for student engagement with history of technology and well as current news in each discipline. Annotated textbooks with links to context-sensitive links to Engineering Pathway resources will also be explored.", "authors": [{"name": "Flora P.

Unfortunately, the cost of the required hardware is prohibitively expensive for many departments for what is typically a once-a-semester demonstration. So we decided to port the algorithm to a platform that many departments may already have on hand: the LEGO Mindstorms RCX 2.0. Initially the task seemed relatively straightforward: build a robot base out of LEGO parts and implement the algorithm in the Not Quite C language. However the challenges of designing a robot arm without servos and attempting to trim code down to a size that would fit on the RCX has proven to be as educational to the undergraduates working on the project as we hope the final product will be to students in AI classes.

At the interface of modern physics and quantum mechanics, these tools are not presently as widely used. The Modern Physics course at American University presents an ideal opportunity for conceptual assessment given its somewhat atypical student composition. In this study both qualitative and quantitative measures of student understanding of a key concept in modern physics, the photoelectric effect are utilized. As a quantitative overall baseline for gain, the Quantum Physics Conceptual Survey (QPCS) was implemented [1]. A set of questions on the photoelectric effect that required both a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the photoelectric effect were then given on both the midterm and final exams. The results of the QPCS, and a subset of QPCS questions solely on the photoelectric effect, are statistically compared to the more focused approach for assessing the photoelectric effect. Additionally, correlations between subsets of the student population and their gains on the various assessments were investigated. The results from these assessment methods will be discussed in the larger context of how assessment measures can be maximized to enhance student understanding in a modern physics course.

One guiding principle is student responsibility for learning. In order to facilitate learning, faculty and students alike have come up with several learning methods. Learning modes may include self-directed learning, peer-directed learning, one-on-one faculty-directed learning, or industry mentored learning. Peer-directed learning often manifests in the form of learning groups (a group of students learning similar competencies), led by either a faculty member or a student who has previously excelled in that competency and has taken an interest in pursuing advanced credit. Recently, Iron Range Engineering has begun to incorporate student written and student led model eliciting activities. These show promise for creating engagement, exposing misconceptions, and providing high-level learning opportunities for peer-students and peer-teachers. The initial results of these methods have been very positive.

Unfortunately, the recent change of the university program in Germany from the Diploma to the Bachelor/Master model had a direct negative impact on the curricula and the course schedules. The result of which is that the first-year curriculum is overloaded; exercises or practical courses have been dropped altogether from the first term, have been rescheduled to later terms and have been reduced in length. For this reason, other forms of experimenting have to be developed and integrated into the existing courses or lectures; virtual laboratories and remote experiments offer such an option: they enable students to access equipment 24h/7 days a week, they are independent from opening hours and the work schedule of the staff. Furthermore, simulations do have some other advantages: they provide a better control on the simulated phenomenon, allow observing effects and running experiments that are only very hard to measure or perform in practical applications. Another advantage besides their cost-efficiency is that simulations allow observations of effects in a simplified environment without any measurement errors. Therefore, remote and virtual experiments have already or will soon be set up by various universities across Europe. However, building a pool of experiments sufficient to cover all of undergraduate physics is an overwhelmingly complex and costly task for a single university to handle on its own. Therefore, the EU-funded LiLa project short for \"Library of Labs\" is building a network of virtual laboratories and remote experiments. The LiLa Portal provides access to manifold experiments, free to use in courses and lectures. Additionally, LiLa partners will profit from the experience gained from using remote experiments, and the LiLa network will provide best-practices in applications of remote experiments. This article starts with an introduction of LiLa and its aims; it then presents the integration of virtual labs and remote experiments into an existing course, \"Physics for Engineers\", at the University of Stuttgart.

Related to this is the problem of the public identity of engineering and the influence that engineers are able to wield on public policy. Another crisis relates to the engineers role. Is an engineer a scientist or manager? A related question that has a special bearing on education is the relative status assigned to science when compared with design. Attempts to develop a philosophy of engineering are summarized. The argument that engineering educators should have a defensible philosophy of education is summarized, and the value of screening aims and objectives demonstrated. Arguments for teaching engineering students are summarized, more particularly those that advocate the teaching of the philosophical method as an aid to learning engineering on the one hand, and those that programs focused in one way or another on the teaching of philosophy per se.
