New electronic toolkits and programming environments are also emerging intended to introduce new generations to coding and computation in creative and engaging ways -- that go way beyond Logo. Never before has there been so much opportunity and buzz to make learning accessible, immersive, interactive, exciting, provocative and enjoyable.

In CS courses, a common example used to illustrate the adversary argument is the following problem: Suppose there is an unweighted graph G with $n$ vertices represented by an adjacency matrix. We want to test if the graph is connected. How many entries in the adjacency matrix do we have to probe in order to test if the graph has this property (property being 'connectivity')? Each probe is considered as a query.\nSince the adjacency matrix has only n^2 entries, O(n^2) queries are sufficient. It is also known that Omega(n^2) queries are necessary. Proving this lower bound is more difficult and is done using the adversary argument.\nIn literature, we find that lower bound proofs of this problem rely too much on 'connectivity' property and do not generalize well. When the property being tested is changed, the proof changes significantly.

First I consulted a number of textbooks on didactics in informatics and compiled a list of possible candidates for competencies. The list was used as a QCA category set, by which six different educational approaches were analyzed. Every time a new competency was identified, it was added to the category set and a new iteration of the analyzing process was commenced using the newly enhanced list of competencies. Since the material for the analysis consisted of research documents of existing educational approaches for school education, the result was a collection of competencies with the property of maximal prevalence across the range of educational concepts.

We measure student attitudes, grades, and final course outcomes and find that, while students in the inverted offering do not report increased enjoyment and are no more likely to pass, learning as measured by final exam performance increases significantly. This increase is not simply a function of a more onerous inverted offering, as students report spending similar time per week in the traditional and inverted offerings.

On testing entire cohorts of students in their first year of learning to program, we found an overwhelming majority of them could not cope with such a concept.
