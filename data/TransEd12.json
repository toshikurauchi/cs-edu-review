The setup consists of a small dc electrical motor attached to one of the ends of a light rod. The motor drives a 2-in propeller and allows the rod to swing. Angular position is measured by a potentiometer attached to the pivot point. A custom-designed circuit board produces the controlled voltage input to the motor. The target board is powered and communicates with the PC through its USB port using a virtual RS-232 port. A simple MATLAB/Simulink module has been created to read the pendulum angle and send a command signal to the motor. The module is based on Real-time Windows Target software, which allows a sampling rate of up to 200 Hz. Students are able to design and test classical PID and phase lead-lag controllers, as well as modern controllers, including state-space controller design combined with feedback linearization. A semester-long series of assignments is described that can be carried out without the need for a specialized laboratory or teaching assistants. The project was tested in a classical control systems design class of senior-level mechanical engineering students.

In the stepwise integrated design, only those equations relevant to the present step of the problem were integrated into the circuit diagram; previously displayed equations were moved to an adjacent frame and recorded there.

Embedded software systems, such as those that control cell phones, aircraft, and medical equipment, are subject to requirements and constraints that are significantly different from those encountered in the standard desktop computing environment. For example, embedded systems must frequently address challenges that arise from severe resource restrictions (e.g., low memory and network bandwidth), heterogeneous hardware platforms, and safety-critical operations. Software architecture has been shown to be an effective means for coping with such issues, yet traditional courses on embedded software development rarely focus on software architectural abstractions. Instead, they have concentrated on lower-level issues such as programming languages and hardware interfaces. Since 2005 at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, a unique course has been developed that affords students the opportunity to gain experience and insights on developing software architectures for embedded systems. At the heart of the course is a middleware platform, Prism-MW, that helps students use software architectural principles to construct embedded systems and understand the important challenges of the embedded systems domain. This paper describes this course through the explanation and evaluation of four years of class projects, weaving together the course, the middleware platform, and the relationship of each to three key pedagogical goals that drove the formulation of the course curriculum.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris A.

Student MEMS designs developed using computer-aided design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA) software are fabricated at SNL and returned on 18-mm die modules for characterization and testing. One such module may contain a dozen innovative student projects. Important outcomes include an increase in enrollment in the introductory MEMS class, external research funding and archival journal publications arising from student designs, and consistently high finishes in the SNL competition. Since the SNL offerings are available to any US college or university, this curriculum is transportable in its current form.", "authors": [{"name": "Richard O.

For this, a virtual machine-based framework was defined, and an automatic evaluation system implemented. The evaluation system can handle the large student numbers characteristic of distance learning.
