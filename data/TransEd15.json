[{"title": "A Study on the Difficulties of Learning Phase Transition in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design From the Viewpoint of Semantic Distance", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6857435/", "abstract": "Students in object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) courses typically encounter difficulties transitioning from object-oriented analysis (OOA) to logical design (OOLD). This study conducted an empirical experiment to examine these learning difficulties by evaluating differences between OOA-to-OOLD and OOLD-to-object-oriented-physical-design (OOPD) transitions from the perspective of semantic distance in the context of semantic network theory. The experimental results indicated that two factors inhibit the learning of OOA-to-OOLD transition: the semantic distance between phases and the precise degree of transition relations. The OOA-to-OOLD transition exhibits a greater semantic distance than the OOLD-to-OOPD transition, which causes difficulty in retrieving and understanding the semantics of OOA-to-OOLD transition relations. OOA-to-OOLD transition relations are less precise, which causes learners to have difficulty in developing efficient schema acquisition and automation when learning OOA-to-OOLD transition. These results provide further insight into the cognitive processes of learners who are learning phase transition. This may guide educators to develop an effective learning instruction method for phase transition and motivate researchers to remedy the inherent deficiency of phase transition in OOAD by considering the cognitive processes of developers.", "authors": [{"name": "Shin-Shing Shin", "affiliation": "Information Science and Management Systems, National Taitung University, Taitung, Taiwan, R.O.C."}], "tags": ["object-oriented methods", "semantic network theory", "Automation", "semantic distance", "Object-oriented analysis and design", "computer science education", "OOA-to-OOLD transition learning", "semantic networks", "network theory (graphs)", "Unified modeling language", "OOPD transitions", "cognition", "phase transition", "learning phase transition", "object-oriented analysis and design courses", "OOLD-to-object-oriented-physical-design transitions", "Object oriented modeling", "Semantics", "Problem-solving", "educational courses", "learning instruction method", "OOA-to-OOLD transition relations", "cognitive processes", "Computational modeling", "OOAD courses", "object-oriented analysis and logical design", "Materials"]}, {"title": "DSP-Based Hands-On Laboratory Experiments for Photovoltaic Power Systems", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6823188/", "abstract": "This paper presents a new photovoltaic (PV) power systems laboratory module that was developed to experimentally reinforce students' understanding of design principles, operation, and control of photovoltaic power conversion systems.

In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints.

ReAct! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications.

The other group learned with colored circuit variables, with blue font indicating variables related to voltage, red font indicating those related to current, and black font indicating those related to resistance. The color group achieved significantly higher post-test scores, gave higher ratings for liking the instruction and finding it helpful, and had lower ratings of cognitive load than the black-font group.

A mixed research methodology was applied. Quantitative research investigated how the performance of students with various levels of high school GPAs correlated with their rating of their lecturers' teaching proficiency. Four lecturers and 336 mechanical and electronics engineering students participated in the study. Achievement tests, consisting of problems to be solved by using models of a diode and an ideal operational amplifier, were implemented in introductory courses in electronics. Students taught by lecturers whom they rated as having high levels of teaching expertise achieved significantly higher grades on these tests than did students taught by lecturers receiving lower ratings for their teaching expertise. The tests investigated performance on three taxonomy levels, and the results were consistent on all three levels. The grades on the knowledge taxonomy level were higher than the grades on the routine level, and both were higher than the grades on the interpretation level, as expected.

Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266 individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday workshop, seven conference sessions, and several other virtual and in-person activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms arranged in 14 branches and six levels. This taxonomy was found to satisfy four criteria for validity and reliability: (1) keywords assigned to a set of abstracts were reproducible by multiple researchers, (2) the taxonomy comprised terms that could be selected as keywords to fully describe 243 articles in three journals, (3) the keywords for those 243 articles were evenly distributed across the branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the authors of 31 conference papers agreed with 90% of researcher-assigned keywords.

TBL provides students with opportunities to not only learn course content better than in the traditional lecture-based setting, but also to develop various transferable professional skills, such as self-directed independent learning, problem solving, and interpersonal team skills. Because of these potential benefits, TBL was adapted as the principal teaching and learning strategy in a two-course sophomore-level electric circuit theory sequence, where it has been used since 2010. This paper describes beneficial changes that have evolved in the implementation of TBL in the circuit theory sequence. Those changes have been based, in part, on student evaluations of the strategy, which are described. Finally, instruments used to assess student learning in the TBL-taught courses are also described. They provide evaluation information that suggests the described revised version of TBL is an effective way to facilitate learning of both technical content and several professional skills in the sophomore-level electric circuit theory sequence.", "authors": [{"name": "Robert M.

Since points are awarded on a first-come-first-served basis to only a limited number of the students who submit correct answers, students are required to concentrate on the lecture if they want to score. The proposed method solves both the problem of decreased concentration arising from frequent use of smartphones for nonlearning purposes in lectures and of inefficient interaction that occurs in large university classrooms.
