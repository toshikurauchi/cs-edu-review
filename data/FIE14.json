Effective alternatives exist are less well-known. Reasons for the prevalence of pie charts, bar charts, and tables include: they are native to Office software; engineers and engineering educators generally lack training in visual rhetoric; new designs require additional work and technical skill of the author; and audiences resist change. This workshop addresses some of these barriers to change. The superior alternative to pie charts, bar charts, and (some) tables is the dot plot, a display type absent from Office but native to R, an open-source software environment originating in the statistics community. Workshop participants learn why dot plots are effective and how to create them using R. The workshop is designed for R beginners. The agenda includes active learning, demonstration, and discussion. Programming topics are developed using self-paced tutorials. Participants, from any discipline, interested in learning why and how to improve their graphical communication of quantitative data are welcome. Participants should bring wireless-capable laptops. After completing the workshop, participants should be able to describe the limitations of pie charts, bar charts, and tables, cite principles underlying more effective graphs, and use R to create dot plots. By developing participants' technical skills and rhetorical skills in this way, we serve the greater goal of improving their abilities to explore data and communicate findings, helping them use the logic of a display design to better support the logic of their argument.", "authors": [{"name": "Richard Layton", "affiliation": "Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, Terre Haute, Indiana, USA"}], "tags": ["software", "rhetoric", "bars", "visualization", "tutorials", "conferences"]}, {"title": "Evaluability assessment for engineering educators: Pre-conference workshop proposal and outline", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2014.7043984", "abstract": "Evaluability assessment (EA) is used to determine the readiness of a program for outcome evaluation. For engineering educators, obtaining meaningful outcome evaluation findings can be illusive. Determining whether a program is ready for such an evaluation, has critical importance, particularly as expectations for engineering education programs to have real impact, continue to increase. EA use is on the rise internationally with vibrancy in its application across a wide variety of disciplines and programs. Its use has expanded to include formative evaluation, implementation assessment, evaluation planning, program development, and technical assistance. EA is also being used to increase stakeholder involvement, understand program culture and context, and facilitate organizational learning and evaluation capacity building. However, there continues to be ambiguity and uncertainty about the method. Although several EA models exist, the essential elements of EA include stakeholder involvement, developing a program theory, gathering feedback on program theory, and using the EA. In this workshop, a modern model of EA will be presented that incorporates the essential elements of EA with current evaluation theory and practice. The components of this model include: (1) focusing the EA, (2) developing an initial program theory, (3) gathering feedback on program theory, and (4) and using the EA. Participants will learn the \"What, Why, and How\" of EA; specifically: What: Participants will learn the essential elements of EA and how they are incorporated in the EA model presented. Why: Participants will learn the important benefits and advantages of conducting an EA. How: Participants will learn how to implement the EA model presented. Participants will be exposed to a variety of case examples that illustrate features of EA that show how EA can be used across disciplines. Brief video clips of evaluators will be presented to illustrate how evaluators developed and carried out EA projects, issues that arose and how they were dealt with, and unique aspects that emerged in each EA. Participants will also engage in application exercises and related discussion to practice implementing the EA model. These exercises will come from actual engineering education projects and programs, clearly illustrating application of EA for engineering educators. We will administer a pre-workshop questionnaire to identify participant characteristics and prior experience with and interest in EA and program evaluation to better tailor the workshop to participant needs.", "authors": [{"name": "Michael S.

This is especially important in learning environments where the user needs to focus on subject material rather than on the device used to record or store the subject information. Using Tablet PCs and slate devices, instructors are able to increase their effectiveness by making more dynamic presentations and by incorporating active exercises into their classroom environments. Tablet PCs also enable better and more natural note-taking by students and easier after-class review of course material and notes. Further, Tablet PCs facilitate better interaction with persons participating in classroom sessions from remote locations since they easily involve students exchanging visual descriptions of concepts with the instructor and the rest of the class. Several software packages are available to support the pedagogical needs of the university classroom as well as typical group collaborative environments. Classroom Presenter, DyKnow, WriteOn, LectureTools, and MS OneNote with the Interactive Classroom and Math Add in are examples of some of the packages that provide excellent classroom capabilities. These packages allow for a highly interactive environment with both teacher-student and student-student bi-direction real-time interaction. See www.ee.vt.edu/\u223cigtront/tabletpc/ to download tablet PC software. Electronic textbook frameworks like VText are being developed to allow students to have an electronic textbook on their tablet or slate devices. This workshop will also explore the use of these frameworks and how they may be used to enhance student learning practices. In this hands-on tutorial faculty will receive an introduction to the use of Classroom Presenter, OneNote, Interactive Classroom, VText, VectorPad, LectureTools, and PDF Annotator. We will provide sufficient instruction for faculty to have a basic competency with the technology. Most importantly, we will show faculty various pedagogical practices that we have found helpful in using these technology tools in the classroom over the past seven years. Active learning exercises for various disciplines will be emphasized. Faculty will be tasked with developing short active learning exercises starting from the development of goals for the exercise, through the desired student interaction, and ending with the exercise assessment and improvement strategy. These active learning exercises will be targeted to students who are expected to be in the classroom as well as those who may be taking the course at extended campus locations.

Students develop a set of skills, and employ criticism which helps them to better handle future interpersonal situations. There is a vast theoretical literature and numerous case studies about group work, but we haven't yet seen much development concerning the assessment of individual group participants. It is not always easy to have the perception of each student contribution to the whole work. Nevertheless, more than frequently, the assessment of the group is transposed to each group participant, which in turn results in each student having the same final mark. We propose and describe a tool to manage and assess individual group work taking into account the amount of work, interaction, quality, and the temporal evolution of each group participant. The module features the possibility to create two types of activities: collaborative or cooperative group work.

Data structures are organized using conceptual and behavioral issues that require high degree of abstract representation. It has been observed significant difficulty, by students, to understand the abstract concepts related, which is observed during practical tasks. In fact, practical tasks are essential to consolidate knowledge about data structures, but the students need support to understand the concepts before practical tasks. There are several works in literature showing tools to support conceptual and behavior comprehension, each one with specific features. However, the tools by themselves are not enough, dealing with specific data structure, with severe constraint. In literature, some tools are presented using case studies specific to the data structures supported. And we observed that the tools are presented focusing on their functionalities (the case studies are designed to explore such functionalities). Also, we observed the lack of a methodological approach to incorporate tools in a learning process effectively. In this scenario, we address the use of technological support to teaching-learning process. We propose a methodology based on constructionism, in which students, tasks (home works) and tools are coordinated by a teacher in favor of knowledge construction. In order to present our methodology, we use a learning tool, named CADILAG, developed using visual resources to support students understand data structures concepts. We applied the methodology proposed for two years. The positive results are observed in students grades and their evaluation.

These activities accelerated after Bologna process agreement. E-participation not only covers the general participation of citizens, but also enables higher education decision makers to communicate with each other and with all stakeholders within the university. During more than ten years the EU has funded projects in the area of e-democracy and e-participation in order to respond to this emerging requirement. The aim of some of these projects has been to equip universities with e-participation tools or platforms. There have been some EU projects that turned out to become great successes while some other projects have not been particularly useful. Lots of studies have been published about these projects and the core ideas behind them. But they have mainly covered technical aspects and less about non-technical challenges such as socio-cultural differences, rules and regulations and challenges related to unifying different decision making processes. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify the non-technical factors which have an impact for the success of e-participation in higher education. The EU-funded project MyUniversity has been selected as a case study. It involved 17 higher institutions in Europe. Data collection was conducted by means of recorded semi structured interviews with stakeholders of the MyUniversity project. Data-analysis was done using a systematic coding of audio flies using the Nvivo software and based on grounded theory principles. The emerging main categories of non-technical factors identified by interpreting data have been the major contribution of this study. The study clearly demonstrates that non-technical factors were very influential in the MyUniversity project. The following nontechnical factors were identified as crucial for the success of e-participation in higher education: 1) The socio-cultural context, 2) Identification of users, 3) Usability, drivers and motivation. The study showed that deeper needs assessments locally at each university and \"cultural studies\" are very crucial and should not be neglected, even though conducting them for every single involved country or institution are both budget and time consuming. Moreover, each educational institute should use its own motivational techniques based on their cultural studies in order to involve their users.

Being inserted into a student schedule that was otherwise based on a traditional course format, however, the flexibility of the auto-tutorial course led to withdrawal rates of around 50% in the early version of the course. The main problem was that students prioritized based on deadlines; therefore the flexibility of a self-paced course could not compete with the fixed deadlines of traditional courses.

An example of how this qualitative method has been employed in studying approaches to learning is provided along with the types of findings that emerge from this work. While positivism seeks to explain and model, phenomenology only aims to describe yet both camps seek to obtain some sense of truth.

PEs encompass various dimensions of knowledge: where it comes from, how it is created, how it is organized, how universal it is, etc. Likewise, despite their significant role in structuring thought and action, metaphors have received scant attention within engineering education.

A phased undergraduate engineering program with multiple specializations is analyzed within this context. Based on their performance at the end of first phase, selected students were provided opportunities using scholarship to pursue completion of their degree requirements at various European universities. This paper will elaborate the impact of differing pedagogical interventions, language and cultural differences amongst these countries on students in diverse engineering disciplines. The data presented is based on on the feedback analysis from Eramus Mundus students (N=121) that underwent the mobility programs.

Post-test and exam data from an introductory circuits course show that after the tutorial many students still had difficulties with voltage and potential. More than three quarters of the responses concerning voltage and potential were inconsistent. This suggests that most students were unable to link those two concepts.

Providing access to existing learning resources in a way that teachers, students and parents are able to discover, acquire, discuss and adapt them to their own learning scenarios will also promote the development of values and attitudes that play a fundamental role in the educational process, such as team work, collaboration and critical thinking. In turn, this will foster the development of learning networks and communities. In this context, teachers play an instrumental role as facilitators, as their expertise enables them to assess the quality of content and to design and adapt learning activities according to individual learners' profiles. However, we wanted to find out how the interaction with open educational resources would enhance teachers' activities, if digital resources could be easily integrated in their actual educational curricula, or if teachers felt that the introduction of these resources would improve the educational experience of their students. This paper addresses the usage and usability of open educational resources from teachers' perceptions. For this, we utilized the Open Discovery Space portal, a socially-powered and multilingual open educational resources' repository intended to support teachers, students and parents to intuitively identify, share, reuse and revise digital learning resources. This analysis was performed taking into account both actual content and ancillary services offered by the portal (e.g., content sharing, content discussion, community building), and was methodologically organized as a streamlined cognitive walkthrough that included two evaluation workshops in late 2013 and early 2014, and a further debriefing survey in mid 2014. The first workshop included a brief course to teachers on the functionalities and aims of the Open Discovery Space portal and an assessment survey. The second workshop was devoted to answer the questions posed by the teachers participating after a 6-week period of usage and reflection. Again, the workshop was completed with an assessment survey on the portal's content and services.

To counteract this effect, research and educational activities have been designed at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayag\u00fcez Campus (UPRM) to create an enriching, hands-on-experience in energy systems for current and future female undergraduates. This paper describes how the department of electrical and computer engineering has developed educational strategies to increase the female participation in the energy systems area at UPRM. Some of these strategies include: a) Deliver hands on experience to prospect high school and freshmen college students, with special emphasis on female participants b) Enhance teamwork skills in project development and interdisciplinary work c) Create lasting interest in the study and design of energy systems. Activities based on these strategies range from building simple photovoltaic arrangements and small induction motors, to computer programming. The strategies presented in this paper have already been integrated with the mechanical, and the electrical and computer engineering class curriculums.

Proper implementation of a flipped classroom is difficult to gauge, but combines successful techniques for distance education with constructivist learning theory in the classroom. While flipped classrooms are not a novel concept, technological advances and increased comfort with distance learning have made the tools to produce and consume course materials more pervasive. Flipped classroom experiments have had both positive and less-positive results and are generally measured by a significant improvement in learning outcomes. This study, however, analyzes the opinions of students in a flipped sophomore-level information technology course by using a combination of surveys and reflective statements.

There are many experiments reported in the literature that attempted to solve this problem, such as: different pedagogical approaches, the use of special hardware like tablets, and the use of learning objects; however, all these formats are applied based on traditional classroom learning formats which results in the same type of result. Even some innovative approaches that did not present a formal validation of the process ended up losing as a methodology. Considering this scenario and the importance of this discipline in students' curriculum, we propose a blended model, that uses distance learning environments allied to new technologies, aimed to contribute with students performance and knowledge acquirement. In this blended model, one programming course was developed and applied to 92 students in computer science and engineering degrees, with course material consisting of video lectures and animations that were used to show and to explain critical concepts of the discipline where students often have problems. All this material was implanted by a Learning Management System (LMS), which showed statistical reports about all activities, including collaborative and interactive activities. We also used together with the LMS a dedicated community on Facebook and, in this article we present our analysis and some conclusions obtained by observing the interactions of students on Facebook and on LMS.

This paper describes action research underway, to explore the use of the argument map, as a structured means of leveraging mental models to promote critical thinking. In this paper, interactive small-group tasks based on argument maps are presented, and outputs generated by the initial cohort of undergraduate senior learners on these tasks are examined for evidence of critical thinking.

On the one hand, it would be convenient to include CS instruction in higher education beyond engineering disciplines, since CS has become a powerful catalyzer for development of society, and therefore the need for a workforce with solid CS background is growing. On the other hand, it would be beneficial to bring CS instruction to primary and secondary education, used as a vehicle to increase interest in CS and capture talent for STEM disciplines from early stages. However, successful delivery of CS instruction to a wide audience is a challenge. Game-based learning is one of the most promising approaches at the moment, since they have the power to appeal to wider audiences. In this paper we identify the need to find more scalable game-based instruction paradigms that can be easily adapted to variable levels of complexity and contents related to CS. We present a flexible and scalable game architecture, and a game model to create videogames for learning CS languages, along with a game engine developed as a reference implementation. The game model focuses on level-based games where the student has to introduce short text fragments or programs to solve each of the levels. This game model is consistent to others found in the literature (Scratch, Logo, etc.) that have proven it effective, since it allow students to discover programming in a self-exploratory way, using their own intuition and learning from their mistakes. Our approach is scalable because (1) it separates the CS language used to write the programs from the game design, allowing reusing the games with different CS markup or programming languages; and (2) it provides a system of levels that allows incremental learning of CS language structures. The approach was tested by developing \"Lost in space\", an educational game for learning XML. In this game, students control a spaceship, and their goal is to reach a safe point in each of the levels. They provide instructions to the ship with short programs that they write using XML-based instructions. At the beginning students can use a small set of instructions. As they master these types of instructions, new ones become available, supporting in this manner scaffolded learning. The game was tested with undergraduate students from computer science and social sciences, by comparing it with traditional instruction (i.e. lecture). Students who played the game were much more engaged than those who attended the lecture, showing a more active attitude along the whole experience and also spent more time practicing after class. Findings also suggest that the game was effective for instruction regardless of the background of the students. However, the educational gain observed with the game-based instructional approach, even effective, was not significantly higher than traditional instruction.

Some students may work quite hard whereas others may rarely participate in the group work, but it is almost impossible for professors/instructors to identify contributions of individual students in detail. In contrast, students in the same group are obvious choices for appropriate evaluators of other members since they have first-hand knowledge of the collaborative work.

This empirical study attempts to craft a richer description and understanding of how soft skills are integrated into the teaching and learning of the formal curriculum focusing on technical courses at a private university in Malaysia. The study was based on both quantitative method, utilizing questionnaire survey and qualitative methods through document analysis and focus group interviews. Perspectives from both the educators and students were sought. The questionnaire survey was aimed at providing an overall pattern of the participants' approaches and views on the integration while document analysis and focus group interviews presented the complementary details behind their reasons. The results of the study indicate that the most pertinent teaching approaches to be employed in integrating soft skills for technical courses are the student-centered teaching methods. The study also reveals that the lecturers place a great deal of emphasis on critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as communication skills which are crucial skills for engineers. The findings of the study have drawn attention to the importance of paying heed to how students' ability in soft skills are developed by the educators on their teaching since most of students' learning time is devoted to their core courses. The findings also acknowledge the contributions of educators with industry experience to the development of students' soft skills abilities, which is further deliberated in this paper.", "authors": [{"name": "Hairuzila Idrus", "affiliation": "Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Malaysia"}], "tags": ["decision support systems"]}, {"title": "Professional competency attainment in a project based learning curriculum: A comparison of project based learning to traditional engineering education", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2014.7044124", "abstract": "An upper division undergraduate project-based learning (PBL) engineering program in the U.S. engineering educational system was started beginning January 2010.

People working within that field are familiar with this language and use it carrying a very specific meaning that might or might not be aligned with the use in everyday language. Three categories of technical terms can be distinguished. In the neutral category, technical terms are expressed using words that are not part of everyday language and that students learn from the instructor, giving the instructor a blank canvas to work with. However, technical terms often use language that carries a meaning in everyday language. Depending on the meaning, associations are provoked that can help or hinder understanding the technical meaning of the terms. Especially in cases where the everyday meaning of a term is not aligned with the technical meaning, this can lead to student misunderstandings of concepts that are hard to unveil because both students and instructors are using the same terms without being aware that they are not talking about the same meaning of those terms. In addition to difficulties introduced in the native language already, a second level of difficulty arises in a globalized world where instructor and students potentially have several different native languages. Now terms that might be provoking misleading associations for parts of the group might be neutral or even helpful for others, leading to a higher degree of complexity to be dealt with by the instructor and students alike.

The purpose of the competition was to test the student teams' abilities to develop creative solutions to an open ended problem given limited time and unconventional resources. One question that arose while developing the competition was the impact that individual creativity and team creative composition would have on the final product. The results were somewhat surprising; teams with the highest average scores of individual creativity performed the worst in judging of the creativity of the final product. While the reasons for this are unclear, the most likely reasons were a) lack of time to incubate creative ideas b) an inability to articulate creative ideas physically in the constructed project or c) a limit in the ability of creative, or divergent, thinkers to converge upon a single solution. Additionally, teams that had a large range of individual creativity scores, or more specifically, a single dominant \"creative\" thinker, also failed to score well in the creativity potion of the competition The current work in progress examines the composition of design teams to develop a taxonomy based on a) average team scores of individual team member creativity and b) range of individual creativity on a team. Based on the Innovation Phase Model (1PM), different phases of innovation emphasize different dominant thinking processes. The IPM includes the stages of Invention (preparation, activation, generation, illumination, verification) and Exploitation (communication and validation). Teams that excel in invention may not excel in exploitation. Alternatively, some teams may actualize their ideas very well, but may not have the same ability to generate fluency and flexibility and novelty in their solutions. By categorizing team characteristics, we can examine if specific team compositions are more likely to perform well in specific phases of the IPM The current focus is on the divergent stages of Invention including activation (problem definition) and generation (fluency in solutions) as well as the convergent stage of illumination (reduction to a few promising solutions.)

In educating the inventors of our future, it is important to address creativity as a condition for innovation in Engineering courses of study. Part of the creative potential lies in the ability of divergent thinking. This looking for not yet existing patterns is also one of the characteristics of improvisation. Breaking the routine, staying positive, putting focus on others, staying in the present moment and daring to fail are the basic rules for improvisation, with having fun as a bonus. As Albert Einstein said, no problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it. A disruption in the existing thinking and acting patterns has to be initiated. Giving participants no time to prepare or think things through, in other words giving them the opportunity and obligation to improvise is a mean to cause such a disruption. This way, participants get in the right mood, step out of their comfort zone and focus on the things that are happening in the here-and-now, in essence the right conditions for enhancing divergent thinking. The workshop in improvisation skills lasts 90 minutes and has the following structure: 00.00\u201300.20 hours: physical and concentration warming up 00.20\u201300.40 hours: exercises in pairs 00.40\u201301.10 hours: games 01.10\u201301.20 hours: cooling down 01.20\u201301.30 hours: evaluation In all parts of the workshop, people are challenged to solve problems with no more than their imagination. This way, they learn to take initiative, listen carefully, react spontaneously and enjoy making mistakes. The essence of improvisation touches the heart of creativity: acting in the here-and-now, accepting mistakes and learning to look for novel associations. The workshop can serve 30 participants maximum. The workshop leader is a lecturer professional skills who recently started a Ph.D.-research on innovative behavior in higher Engineering education. She teaches improvisation for almost six years now in an Engineering course of study in the Netherlands. She is also the co-author of a book (in press) about improvisation and entrepreneurship.

Rather than viewing framing and metaphors as purely cinematic or poetic devices, for example, we can understand how they represent the encoding and representation of knowledge and a mechanism for automaticity in comprehension. These theories also provide a framework for analysis of media and interaction and a growing set of tools for designing user experience by basing our analytical and design tools and methodologies more firmly on empirical research. For example, how does one translate fairly abstract ideas and emotions into the procedural mechanics of the underlying systems upon which we implement interaction designs? Do we have predictive models that facilitate our ability to conduct research related to the design, implementation and effects of interactive media and games? As a beneficial side effect, learning about the power and automaticity of these cognitive processes might also help inoculate both students and faculty against the abusive use of neuroscience as it is incorporated into games, marketing, public relations and political propaganda.

Based on competency maps, this model allows careful analysis, revision and iteration for an effective integration of professional skills. We define each competency in terms of \"dimensions\" (or sub-skills), which are further defined according to three-level objectives. Competency maps are built showing the specific graded objectives, which allows to integrate them most finely into degree subjects. A global competency map is also designed including the objectives to be achieved throughout the degree. This global map becomes a useful tool for curriculum designers and coordinators. It allows them to optimize the workload, and to make adjustments most effectively, helping students develop the defined competencies as a global comprehensive experience.

The main difference from the other project-based courses is that the OIE course is compulsory, which means every student must take this course. Here comes the problem. Young students usually are rebellious somehow. They would be enthusing about what they choose to do, while would be reluctant to even the same thing if they were arranged to do it. Moreover, students from China are good at theoretical knowledge but lack of initiative. Most of them prefer working alone to being a team member. These are stereotypes but also partly truth.

This approach provides an insightful guide to implementing PBL from xPBL methodology, and provides instruments based on management techniques such as 5W2H (what, why, who, when, where, how and how much) and the production of artifacts to support the conception process of courses based on PBL.", "authors": [{"name": "Felipe Furtado", "affiliation": "N.E.X.T Research Group, UFPE - Centro de Inform\u00e1tica Recife, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Simone C. dos Santos", "affiliation": "N.E.X.T Research Group, UFPE - Centro de Inform\u00e1tica Recife, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Walquiria Lins", "affiliation": "Education Area, C.E.S.A.R Recife, Brazil"}], "tags": ["problem-solving", "guidelines", "software", "context", "planning", "training"]}, {"title": "Improving communication skills: Students' viewpoint on a content & language integrated learning project", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2014.7044179", "abstract": "The development of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) scheme in Spanish universities implies a greater participation of the students in their own process of learning and competence-based teaching.

Effective methods for assessment and early prediction of learning effectiveness in SE teamwork are not only a critical part of teaching but also of value in industrial training and project management. This paper presents a novel analytical approach to the assessment and, most importantly, the prediction of learning outcomes in SE teamwork based on data from our joint software engineering class concurrently taught at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Fulda University, Germany (Fulda). Our approach focuses on assessment and prediction of SE teamwork in terms of ability of student teams to apply best SE processes and develop SE products. It differs from existing work in the following aspects: a) it develops and uses only objective and quantitative measures of team activity from multiple sources, such as statistics of student time use, software engineering tool use, and instructor observations; b) it leverages powerful machine learning (ML) techniques applied to team activity measurements to identify quantitative and objective factors which can assess and predict learning of software engineering teamwork skills at the team level. In this paper we provide the following contributions: a) we present in detail for the first time the full team activity measurement data set we developed, consisting of over 40 objective and quantitative measures extracted from student teams working on class projects; b) we present a ML framework which applies the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to the team activity measurements and team outcomes, focusing on predicting teams that are likely to fail; c) we describe in detail our now fully implemented and operational data processing pipeline, consisting of data collection methods from multiple sources, ML training database creation, and ML analysis subsystems; and finally d) we present very preliminary results of ML analysis results based on the data from our joint software engineering classes in Fall 2012, and Spring 2013, with the data from 17 student teams.

Camp participants were interviewed to address the following research questions: 1) How did the camp fulfill its purpose and intended student outcomes? 2) Were the purpose and intended outcomes reflected in student perceptions? 3) Did the camp experience influence a student's decision to attend the hosting university as well as choice of major? This camp fulfilled its purpose and encouraged students to attend the host university and major in a STEM field. The anticipated cognitive and social outcomes were reflected in the student's experiences at camp. Informal learning environments, such as the one described in this study, can result in increased achievement, self-efficacy, and interest in STEM along with encouraging students to pursue STEM careers.", "authors": [{"name": "Cheryl Ann Peterson", "affiliation": "Aggie STEM, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"}, {"name": "Sandra B.

The literature regarding teacher professional development has reached considerable consensus regarding the features of the PD activities that lead to successful programs. However, the literature shows an insufficient analysis of the teacher motivation to attend professional development activities. In order to attract teachers and maintain their sustained involvement in professional activities, these activities need to be designed keeping in mind the teachers' background and motivation.

This metric had been used in the application experiment in 13 programming courses, and about 1,700 sets of data was collected. From these data, the learners' model, characteristics of the change of motivation, and ways of improving teaching materials had been clarified. However, these study results were obtained after the terms, when the programming courses were over, and thus did not contribute much to the ongoing programming education. For this reason, in this research, the methods for predicting the change of learners' motivation were studied so that the learners who may need support could be identified. The idea came from the experiment the authors conducted, in which the motivation of learners was analyzed by plotting the motivation scores of each factor in the ARCS model as a 3D graph. As a result, a decreasing tendency of motivation was observed when the distribution of the plot widened. After studying the tendency in detail, it was thought to be due to the influence of the variance of sub-level category scores. In the proposed method, the motivation of each learner is assessed in each lesson using the ARCS assessment metric. If variance of the motivation scores of a learner in a lesson is above a certain threshold value AND if mean of the scores has not decreased from the previous lesson, then the learner is identified as a candidate of learner who needs support at that lesson. In the application experiment, a programming course with 9 lessons was offered and 9 learners attended all the 9 lessons. In the experiment, 7 cases had been identified as the candidates of learners who need support, and out of those 7 cases, a decrease of motivation to less than average was observed in 5 cases.", "authors": [{"name": "Yasuhiro Takemura", "affiliation": "Department of Character Creative Arts, Osaka University of Arts, Osaka, Japan\u00a0"}, {"name": "Hidekuni Tsukamoto", "affiliation": "Department of Character Creative Arts, Osaka University of Arts, Osaka, Japan\u00a0"}, {"name": "Akito Monden", "affiliation": "Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan\u00a0"}, {"name": "Hideo Nagumo", "affiliation": "Department of Social Welfare and Psychology, Niigata Seiryo University, Niigata, Japan\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ken-ichi Matsumoto", "affiliation": "Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"}], "tags": ["programming profession", "manganese", "measurement", "educational institutions", "materials"]}, {"title": "Motivations and experiences of older transfer students in engineering", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2014.7044222", "abstract": "Non-traditional students older than traditional college age (18\u201324) face particular challenges in the demanding engineering curriculum.

Data reveal that student reflection on self-directed learning experiences is prompted by different factors. Moreover, we find that one of the more important factors in eliciting various levels of reflective practice is a set of challenges students face in learning environments. Specifically, the three types of challenges emerging from the data are those associated with (1) lack of cognitive freedom in course content, (2) perceived poor performance on traditional assessment, and (3) specific learning environments.

To better understand students' growth as lifelong learners, we conducted a two-year pilot study of engineering students at two institutions. The study approach was based on established motivation theory, as well as social-cognitive frameworks for self-regulated learning. Quantitative results revealed that students at both institutions reported autonomous motivations and an emphasis on learning over grades \u2014 encouraging indicators of lifelong learning. Students showed positive beliefs about learning, with both groups endorsing constructive over reproducible knowledge, dynamic over fixed learner ability, social over individual learning, and relatively high comfort with ambiguity. Unfortunately, the quantitative portion of the study did not reveal many significant temporal changes in students' self-directed learning development. In this paper, we explore possible reasons for the lack of significant quantitative temporal shifts, from both theoretical and methodological perspectives. We examine questions of survey construct relevance, time scales for change, situational versus contextual level data, and group size.

Faculty development workshops are often designed to share best practices that participants can implement at their home institutions. However, the influence of these workshops on participants is rarely studied beyond the use of short exit surveys, often with highly targeted and quantitative questions that leave little room for responses on faculty experiences that may fall outside the workshop's explicit learning objectives. This paper depicts an exploratory qualitative study focused on participant experiences at a week-long faculty workshop on innovation in engineering education. We present our findings in the form of a fable/analogy. Attendees enter the workshop identifying as good teachers on a quest to find the \"Mythical Phoenix,\" a legendary way of educating engineers with a reputation for being \"new\" and \"innovative,\" even if they are not entirely clear on what that may look like. Participants enter with expectations of harnessing the \"Mythical Phoenix\" to take home, but must adjust their thinking when they come to see the \"Mythical Phoenix\" is actually an adapted collection of local practices built over time by faculty much like themselves. Alternating between the perspective of a student (in the workshop) and a teacher (at their home institution) contributes to the changes faculty articulate in their thinking throughout the workshop experience.

Other interactions such as those that a student has with teaching assistants or peers in extracurricular activities seem to have less value for predicting retention.

In this paper, we study this somewhat puzzling difference in outcomes for black transfer students. Using an updated version of the longitudinal data set used in the earlier study that enables us to distinguish transfers from two- versus four-year institutions, we find that (1) black students in engineering are more likely to transfer from other four-year institutions than from two-year institutions, and (2) transfers from two- versus four-year institutions differ on several key characteristics, including gender, full- versus part-time enrollment status, and education outcomes including six-year graduation in engineering. Observing that our earlier results were driven by transfer students from four-year institutions, we focus this analysis on transfers from two-year colleges to identify factors associated with their performance and persistence in engineering. We find that gender and academic achievement (engineering GPA) \u2014 not transfer status \u2014 are driving graduation outcomes for two-year black transfer students. Black women are 28 percent less likely to drop out, IS percent less likely to fail an engineering course, and 25 percent more likely to graduate in engineering in six years than black men. In terms of performance, for every tenth of a grade point increase in engineering GPA, the odds of a black student graduating with an engineering degree in six years improves by 13.7 percent.

In this paper, we discuss how some of these cultural traditions influence these students as well strategies for the recruitment and retention by capitalizing on these traditions. Following best practices developed by American Indian educators and tribal colleges, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has developed a new program in 2008, Tiospaye, a Lakota word for extended family, offers a new paradigm for recruitment and support for American Indian students. The program centers on support areas which include financial support, academic support, mentoring and positive intervention, research opportunities, and social networking. In this paper we include a discussion of the types of support offered in each of the support areas as well as lessons learned and steps for improvement. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the necessary conditions needed to promote sustainability of the program.", "authors": [{"name": "Stuart Kellogg", "affiliation": "Industrial Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD"}, {"name": "Carter Kerk", "affiliation": "Industrial Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD\u00a0"}], "tags": ["sociology", "employee welfare", "educational institutions", "engineering profession", "scholarships", "statistics", "cultural differences"]}, {"title": "The impact of active learning strategies in second cycle students of an engineer course: A case study", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2014.7044272", "abstract": "In the last years the educational research advocates the use of new teaching and learning approaches, particularly in Higher Education.

Having this in consideration, we implement in the University of Aveiro course of optoelectronics, several strategies that seek to develop transversal competences in future physical engineers. Some of the implement strategies were, for example, minute paper, eBook writing, brainstorming session followed by a concise written report, group development of an experimental short scientific project and feedback assessment to all of these strategies.

Today, there seems to be a consensus that teaching software engineering requires students to perform practical experiences that simulate the work in the software industry. This represents a challenge for universities and instructors, because these experiences are complex to setup and involve considerable time and effort. Although there are several experiences and proposals reported in the literature, there is no clear solution to address this challenge. Aim: Being knowledgeable about the several approaches reported in the literature for dealing with this challenge is the first step to proposing a new solution. Counting on this knowledge allows instructors to reuse lessons learned from other universities. In order to address this challenge, we conducted a systematic mapping study that intends to answer the following questions: What are the main approaches used to address the practical experiences in software engineering education? Is there an emerging tendency to address this challenge? Which software process models are used to support the practical experiences in software engineering courses? Have the universities changed the way of conducting these experiences over the years? What are the main forums to seek information on practical approaches for teaching software engineering? Method: We used a systematic mapping study to identify and classify available research papers that report the use of practical experiences in software engineering education. Results: There were 173 papers selected, analyzed and classified. The results indicate that universities have realized the value of including practical experiences as part of the software engineering teaching process. However, few proposals indicate how to address that challenge. The practical approaches identified in this study were game learning, case studies, simulation, inverted classrooms, maintenance projects, service learning, and open source development. Only one recent report on the use of traditional approaches (i.e., teaching using expositive lectures) was found. The use of a development process to support these practical experiences seems not to be a concern for software engineering instructors. Only 40% of these studies report the use of a development process to guide the process experience. The reported processes are mainly agile methods. Conferences are the most used forum to publish studies in this area (72%). One third of these studies have been published over the last five years. Conclusion: There is a clear concern for teaching software engineering involving practical experiences, and there are several initiatives exploring how to do it. The map gives us an overview of the different proposals to address this challenge, and also allows us to make some preliminary conclusions about the preferred approaches.", "authors": [{"name": "Sergio F.

However, engineering students are not currently taught to access, understand, or value this somatic knowledge in problem-solving processes such as design and ethics. To address this need, we are incorporating a series of developmentally-oriented experiences in enhanced somatosensory awareness adapted from somatics and performing arts into two short courses in the Summer of 2014. Both courses involve assistive technology design projects with community partners of differently-abled clients, but one is located internationally and the other domestically. We will utilize multiple measures of empathie perspective-taking in the context of engineering design and ethical reasoning before and after the courses to assess change. We believe this novel application of practices of somatic learning in the technical field of engineering design and ethical analysis will yield new insights into empathie perspective-taking.

These students have circumvented the restrictive departmental policies which solely support Windows-based PC systems and which (as of this writing) clearly identify the lack of technical support for Mac users. Tablet PCs were the only machines that fully met departmental requirements for several years, and were the \"machine of choice\" in the university's engineering community. This requirement has been unwavering until 2012 when a change was made: the first-year engineering program modified the computer specifications to allow Macintosh computers, with certain stated limitations and precautions. Although still highly discouraged and with no provision for Apple technical support, the change has allowed a greater range of options for incoming cohorts. Whether the use of a Mac in this engineering program is politically correct (PC) or not remains to be discovered; this study intends to shed light on this subject. Building on the work of Firmin, which investigated the lived experiences of Mac users on a PC-dominated campus, this work is unique in its focus on engineering students. The present study poses two questions: 1) How does the level of support for Mac users on a PC-dominated campus impact their experience in the first-year engineering program? And 2) How does technical compatibility affect first year students' day-to-day actions within the engineering program?

For each exam, a student can make up to 3 attempts, however the maximum possible score and time allotted on subsequent attempts is reduced.

The following work-in-progress describes a practice-then-apply scaffolding approach to teaching engineering design. The engineering design process was broken down into three phases: (1) discovery and ideation, (2) concept development and selection, and (3) realization and experimentation. Each phase was presented to students via a mini-project that inserted students into the design process at various stages of the design. The mini-projects afforded students with opportunities to practice and expand their understanding without always having to start at the beginning.

However, this strategic sector has very few adequate specialized academic training in the country, as identified in the study of Animation and Video Games Education [1]. This explains why a study by Universidad de los Andes in 2012, in collaboration with the Ministry of ICT and PROEXPORT, on the domestic supply of digital content, in Colombia people dedicated to this work are mostly professionals in design and systems engineers, programs that now have no specific training for this industry. This makes harder the process of production and game development for the companies, and increases investment costs and time needed to train professionals in the workplace. So, it is necessary to give specialized education in video games. We designed a postgraduate program in Game Development that aims to the needs expressed by this contemporary productive sector. Its aim is to prepare professionals to achieve the creation of high-impact video games for different platforms and devices. The goal is training leaders that will give to the development of projects that promote interdisciplinary and teamwork who are skilled in the production and understand the design process and development of video games.

One such technology is the Educational Testing Service (ETS) web-based service, Criterion. Criterion is an online writing service whose purpose is to help students improve their grasp of the English language through offering critical, detailed feedback in the areas of: grammar, spelling, mechanics, usage and organization, and development. With Criterion, students get the benefit of additional writing practice without adding to the instructor's workload, allowing instructors to focus on the content and style of students' work. To assess the effectiveness of the Criterion writing program, our researchers used the program's analytics to gauge student proficiency, use, and the effectiveness of the program. Criterion provides the instructor with each student's progress from the moment of assignment submission. This allowed researchers to track the number of submissions each student needs to submit an acceptable writing assignment. In this study we compiled all of the data from Criterion and tracked the number of submissions and types of errors and sorted them by major and ethnicity. A high percentage of San Jos\u00e9 State University (SJSU)'s incoming freshmen are remedial in English or mathematics. Furthermore, at SJSU underrepresented minority (URM) students have notably higher remediation rates; 70% of African Americans, 60% of Hispanic students, and 50% of Asian Americans require English remediation during their first year, compared with 31% of Caucasian students. Many of these students are U.S. educated English learners with lower English skills than Native English students. They often struggle to complete their English and writing requirements, which negatively impacts their retention and graduation rates. As an online program that offers none of the bias present in traditional university classes, URM students using Criterion do not feel intimidated or overwhelmed.

Schools of engineering have been challenged to reconsider how they prepare their graduates to bring high level skills and strategies including team focused innovation, a comprehensive engineering problem-solving approach, cultural competence, globally focused ethics, and leadership to the workplace. Numerous prominent organizations including the National Academy of Engineering, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council have charged engineering schools to task on preparing engineers for global workforces. In response, many engineering programs are experimenting with strategies and programs designed to prepare students to solve important engineering problems that stretch far beyond national boundaries geographically, technologically, culturally and socio-politically. Sparse research exists, however, that comprehensively assesses globally focused outcomes associated with such engineering efforts, and the simple question remains: Are international efforts effective? The researchers compare the experiences of students participating in two Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs funded by the National Science Foundation; the NanoJapan International REU Program in Japan and the domestic Rice Quantum Institute (RQT) REU at Rice University. NanoJapan is a twelve-week summer program through which twelve freshman and sophomore physics and engineering students from U.S. universities complete research internships in Japanese nanotechnology laboratories. The RQI is a ten-week undergraduate REU in which sophomore and junior students from U.S. universities complete research in atomic, molecular, optical, surface, materials, chemical and biophysical sciences with faculty at Rice University. The students completed the Engineering Global Preparedness Index (EGPI), a multi-dimensional engineering global preparedness index that measures students' preparedness for global workforces. The four subscales in the EGPI directly align to important \"soft\" or professional skills needed by both engineers and other globally prepared professionals. By comparing EGPI results among participants in a domestic and international research experience, the researchers sought to gain insight into what global workforce competencies were developed in an international setting in comparison with the experience of conducting research in a domestic lab setting. Results indicate that the students in the NanoJapan program demonstrated greater increases in engineering global preparedness than the RQI students, and that the RQI students, who did not go abroad, actually declined on most measures of global preparedness at the end of the summer. The researchers posit that this may be attributed to the NanoJapan curriculum that encouraged participants to actively reflect on cultural aspects of research and to the nature of the international experience itself. Moreover, the NanoJapan experience may more closely mirror the typical global workforce/team experience students will encounter after graduation once entering the workforce.

Results show that while there is variation between students in each group, higher level engineering students reported use of broader and more complex search strategies to assist in finding information for completing projects. In addition, higher level students discussed applying information they found to better understand their design problem, whereas lower level students discussed the application of information less frequently.

Once or twice a week, the prompts were delivered to students through an online classroom management system, and the students wrote short responses online. When students understood that a contemplative response to the prompts would increase both understanding and technical competency, nearly 90% completed the assignments.

Multiple factors influence the extent to which research influences practice in any field. While many highlight the reward system as the pivotal factor, changing the reward structure is difficult and assumes extrinsic motivators are effective for faculty. Therefore, this change alone is unlikely to affect faculty priorities vis-a-vis scholarship and teaching. The paper assumes two premises that provide necessary but not sufficient conditions for engineering education scholarship to influence practice. First, the authors assume that the reward system is at worst neutral and may at best reward faculty members who demonstrate they improve student's attainment of learning outcomes. Second, the authors assume that there are effective channels that provide engineering faculty members with concise, accessible, and effective information that they can use to make informed decisions about their teaching. Starting with these two premises, the authors claim another reason research is not influencing practice sufficiently is that, in the language of entrepreneurship, the engineering education community has not provided sufficiently compelling value propositions for engineering faculty members to adopt research based instructional strategies. While the value proposition of engineering education research is clear to researchers, it may not be clear for the majority of engineering faculty members who do not engage in these knowledge-creation activities.

Our core philosophy is that the practice of engineering design reinforces and provides a method for integrating concepts in mathematics and science, thereby introducing, clarifying, and strengthening conceptual knowledge. It also supports a problem-solving orientation in students that encourages creativity and innovation, an approach that is aligned with the strengthening STEAM movement. The inclusion of engineering design activities in the recently adopted Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS US) provides another opportunity to advocate for the adoption of design-focused, project-based curricula that truly integrates learning across STEM, humanities, and social sciences: a curriculum developed through an evidence-based approach firmly grounded in results of K-12 engineering education research. The motivation for this work comes from the need to identify and develop educational environments that encourage persistence in STEM studies from the earliest grades by nurturing key cognitive and non-cognitive factors in addition to the acquisition of subject knowledge. Participants will experience an Engineering Teaching Kit (ETK) from the student's perspective and learn how to use them in their classes in this special session. They will also learn how ETKs are developed, tested, and implemented in middle and elementary schools. Participants will help identify potential topics and areas for future ETKs. Finally, we will explore how an integrative engineering design-focused, project-based pedagogy and curriculum can become a regular component of the school day. All participants will gain access to the on-line resources of our program.", "authors": [{"name": "Susan K. Donohue", "affiliation": "University of Virginia"}, {"name": "Larry G.

The academy begins with a guest speaker who gives a presentation on a topic under the STEM umbrella, then students participate in multiple activities that typically involve science or engineering. While these academies had been received positively by the faculty, the effectiveness of communicating engineering to the students was uncertain. Is one day of activities truly enough to clear misconceptions of engineering? A post survey was administered where students were asked questions in a similar fashion to the \"Draw an Engineer Test.\" The sample was composed of 6th grade students (N=60) at a small public middle school. The 6th grade students were selected in particular by the investigator in order to draw comparisons to a similar outreach previously done at another school. Responses from the survey provided a degree of insight as to how effective a STEM Academy is at informing students about engineering with its current model. Common misconceptions arose frequently in addition to common trends. The misunderstandings surprisingly manifested as the resistance of students to explore a new field by not deviating from their idealized profession. Also, students were drawn to engineering based on misinformed preconceptions. Suggestions based on this study can lead to improvements in how such an outreach is conducted to properly introduce students to STEM, particularly engineering. This paper will present the results of the first survey and provide discussion on student responses. Comparisons between other outreaches will be made to establish the nature of a STEM Academy in contrast to other K-12 programs designed to promote student interest in science and engineering.

Recent research indicates that a majority of college students who enter Science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors became interested in STEM-related subjects when they were in high school or even earlier, in middle school. But the absence of engineering topics in K-12 science and mathematics curricula means that most potential college students are not prepared academically to study engineering in college or pursue careers in engineering. To address this problem the Next Generation Science Standards integrate engineering design and mathematics into science education. The engineering design process provides an opportunity to teach students about scientific inquiry and helps make connections between the science used in engineering applications in the real world and their classroom science lessons. Most current teachers have not been trained to incorporate engineering topics into classroom lessons and while professional development for teachers is being developed to address this need, summer enrichment programs such as those offered through the Center for Pre-college programs at New Jersey Institute of Technology can be instrumental in filling this void. The current paper describes a summer program for middle school students who would not otherwise have been exposed to engineering topics. Students were presented with a scenario that contains a core problem to be solved. Students were assigned to work in teams and were introduced to the Engineering Design Process as a means to develop a solution to the problem. Students completed a pre and post test which included questions about the Engineering Design Process (EDP) and were required to make a presentation about their solution to the core problem. A rubric has been developed to evaluate students' understanding and application of the EDP from their presentations. Analyses of the pre- and post-tests indicate that most students had no prior knowledge of the engineering design process but learned the steps during the course of the program. Correlations among students' responses to the post-test and scores from the rubric have been found.

There are two main types of STEM integration: content integration and context integration. This multiple-case study used content analysis to assess the type of integration used, if any, in the development of curricula for individual lessons and the unit as a whole. The findings demonstrated that, the overall STEM integrated curricula used content integration, but lessons within were either content integration, context integration, or single disciplined. Cases highlighted show these strategies, but cases that deviated significantly from this model are also highlighted. This research advances our understanding about how teachers develop STEM curricula in an interdisciplinary manner with the intent of implementing in precollege classrooms. It provides models of context and content integration across STEM and models of teachers' curriculum development in context-rich interdisciplinary problem spaces.

This is particularly true when designs are developed to solve world problems; a lack of societal consideration leads to implementation failures when engineers from developed countries attempt to design solutions \"for\" people in developing countries rather than working with them. It has been increasingly recognized in literature that stakeholder participation is critical for designing sustainable solutions. However, translating social and cultural values and stakeholder participation into engineering education remains an elusive challenge for educators. A similar challenge exists with engineering design for American Indian Reservations; however, this challenge is amplified due to a long history of racial tensions, biases, and political oppression that leads to American Indian distrust of mainstream engineers. This work in progress describes an ongoing engineering design project that is designed to meet the needs of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (PRIR) while: a) challenging students at a mainstream university to design within an appropriate cultural context, b) incorporating stakeholder participation and 3) increasing opportunities and interest in Native American participation in engineering. Dialogue between community members of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation (PRIR, where OLC is located), faculty and students of the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) Tribal College, and faculty and students at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) have identified that the PRIR community is interested in collaborating on the design, research, and testing of a sustainable, renewable-energy based food production system. The system should not only to meet the community needs for safe and healthy foods, but also serve as a potential source of economic development for the community. This project includes an extensive partnership and has a strong focus on achieving sustainable design and business development through a multi-disciplinary advisory team. Students from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) have partnered with faculty and students from the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) on the functional design of a renewable-energy based structure for economic development.

As a consequence, there is also a need for methods that can be used to assess the quality of education faithfully. One possible approach is an assessment of whether intended learning outcomes are achieved, i.e. an investigation if the target audience possesses the desired competencies. Assessment of competencies, however, is tricky since competencies are often only vaguely defined. This paper presents SECAT, an approach to assess competencies, and particularly those needed for proper software engineering. To that end, SECAT builds on Rauner's approach for competency assessment in vocational education. Rauner's approach uses nine competency criteria, which are further refined by suitable issues that indicate to which extent a competency is, or should be, present. The main contribution of this paper lies in the adaptation and enhancement of this framework in order to make it useable in software engineering education. Adaptation and enhancements encompass issues such as team and individual assessments, integration of multiple perspectives from various groups of stakeholders, and product- and process-orientation.

In this system, each student has the option of doing \"dynamic\" exercises in a specific field of a subject. Whenever a student uses the system, an exercise is generated with different parameters and values. The mentioned system (Evaluation System) has been used in the last semesters, achieving the improvement in the students' comprehension and learning level of the Statics subject. The system under development, allows the students to train themselves in different topics of the subject and, at the same time, it allows the teachers to evaluate the learning process. Based on the fact that in the course assessments, an exam with different parameters and values is presented every time a student accesses the system, it is possible that some students present tests with different complexity levels. Therefore, the test could be considered inequitable for some people. This paper presents an analysis of the difficulty level of a test generated with the system. The test was applied to two different groups of students which are taking the course in the 2014-1 semester. The first group took a test where the items' values and parameters were not changed; and the second one, took a test where the items' values and parameters change for each student. Based on the obtained results, a statistical study is made which intends to determine the difficulty and discrimination level of each of the test items, both for the dynamics parameters test and the fixed parameters test in order to finally determine how much varies the items' difficulty due to the parameters variation.

Then, we select other Wikipedia's articles related to the articles selected by the first process, using links and categories of Wikipedia. Furthermore, we calculate degrees of association between the articles and the keywords using PF-IBF, and put the degree on each keyword. Finally, we screen the keywords using his/her curriculum guideline to adjust the keywords to the learning area of the student's school year.

The project involved generating a library of content for 8th grade physical science standards. The demonstrations and activities were specifically selected to promote interest and engage students, while being easy-to-implement for the teachers. The resources were packaged as a mobile app, called CorePal, to make the content highly accessible. CorePal was designed to allow teachers to track their progress and more importantly serve as a powerful guide to integrate science and engineering activities within their curriculum. Since the project was inspired by feedback from middle school teacher workshops for incorporating hands-on activities in classrooms, local science teachers participated in focus group discussions, workshops and surveys to inform CorePal's development. This paper introduces this standards-based hub for middle-school teachers to engage students within the STEM fields. The paper details CorePal's design philosophy and development.

Funding was acquired to retrofit two vans with modern technology and engineering activities. Travel is conducted in colorful vehicles that represent the institution name and bring engineering alive for the select audience. The idea for a mobile program was developed as many school districts do not have resources for field trips. These vans are driven to area schools to promote all engineering disciplines to K-12 students and educators. Engineering activities are also demonstrated outside the vehicles at scheduled school locations. The goal of the EW project is to deliver engineering concepts into K-12 classrooms using simple cost effective hands on activities. This project is unique in that the activities are developed or selected entirely by engineering students and delivered to school districts by students/faculty. Engineering students develop and pilot the activities, lesson plans, and handouts, for the Engineers on Wheels project through a course called the Engineering Clinic. All engineering disciplines are represented via these activities to give students a well-rounded idea of what different engineering involves. Samples of activities include Solar, Wind and Water Power, Biodiesel and Lip Gloss Processing, Bridge Building, Strength of Materials etc. The goal of the project is to use these activities to mitigate some of the issues that prevent girls and boys from understanding engineering and its specialty areas, thus preventing consideration of engineering as a career choice. Students travel to select school districts throughout the academic year to expose the challenges and excitement of engineering to K-12 students and educators. Surveys are conducted to assess the impact of the program.

Many of these K-12 educators approach STEM disciplines as if each one exists in isolation from the others and they do not integrate the content and skills of the disciplines that can engage students on many levels. Alternately, they may believe that an engineering experience and/or robotics, i.e. an isolated project, can be considered a STEM program. Our responses have focused on STEM education as an interdisciplinary area of study that integrates the four disciplines rather than achieving skills and knowledge independently in each subject area. A STEM program should also provide students experiences in problem-solving, analytical, critical thinking, teamwork, and communication skills. As a result, students should possess the ability to apply, synthesize, and evaluate their knowledge of how the world works within and across the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This paper describes our approaches with educators that can lead to effective implementation of a STEM program to make connections between the STEM disciplines. Examples of program implementation will illustrate two pathways: 1) Development of an \"engineering track\" that begins with an introduction to engineering and engineering design as a problem solving method applied to different engineering problems. This course is then followed by a sequence of modules/courses focusing on different areas of engineering of interest to the educators and their students. This program may be developed as a three- or four-year high school track with the senior year culminating in the University freshman college engineering course for which students can earn dual credit. The content of all courses in the sequence are aligned with the content of science and mathematics courses students are taking or have taken in their high school curriculum. 2) Integration of engineering principles and appropriate applications into the science and mathematics courses offered by the school. Here, students can see the parallel nature of the engineering design process, scientific inquiry process, and mathematical problem solving. Regardless of the chosen pathway, our approach also focuses on the three distinct, but interrelated components of teaching and learning: Instruction, Curriculum, and Assessment of student learning. All interrelated activities are described in lesson plans designed to be aligned with these three components into a coherent process and learning experience aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).", "authors": [{"name": "Levelle E.

A binary logistic regression with two main effects (Course and Grade) and one interaction was performed. Results show that if a student's first course was above Calculus I, they were 2.3 times more likely to be retained in Engineering than a student who took Calculus I. If a student took Pre-calculus or another course below Calculus I they were less than half as likely to persist in Engineering than those who took Calculus I (p<.001). Likewise, if a student received an A or B for their first mathematics course regardless of which course they took, they were 6.5 times more likely to persist than someone who received a D, F, or W in their first mathematics course (p< 0.001).

The FYP is structured around three milestones: project definition, project monitoring and project completion. Skills are assigned to each milestone according to the tasks required in that phase, and a list of indicators is defined for each phase. The evaluation criteria for each indicator at each phase are specified in a rubric, and are made public both to students and teachers.

These issues also apply to theses at bachelor and master level In theses applied research methods are used in order to solve a problem. Theses end an education level and constitute a bridge into work or further studies and even an academic career. This core activity at universities requires a lot of resources and is very time consuming. The thesis quality varies and topic relevance to societal needs is often weak. Another problem is the high dropout and inefficient administrative procedures. Furthermore the digital resources for autonomous learning of research methods aren't optimally provided The European Union's approximately 4000 Higher Education Institutions and about 20 million students need better support in this area The demand for better mass scale support systems in higher education is also a global need with 1200 Higher Education Institutions worldwide (listed by ARWU).

These changes are making it necessary to adapt the curriculum in order to develop the skills needed by the XXI century engineer. Moreover, instead of thinking in a large curriculum reform at a specific moment, it is necessary to define curriculum management processes that include change as a natural component of the process. In addition to these global trends, each institution has a particular context and thus, the analysis in each institution has unique characteristics, a common methodological approach, and a reference model that can be built as long as it is flexible enough to include that context. This paper describes a model developed for curriculum management inside the School of Engineering at Universidad EAFIT \u2014 Colombia. This model includes the institutional context and is based on a process approach defined by the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology. The model uses the Burlton Hexagon as a theoretical framework to identify organizational structure, strategies, policies, infrastructure, technology tools and human capital. It is also a mechanism for specifying curricular macro processes including the global and institutional context. The proposed model is based on three pillars: (a) scientific research in education, which promotes the use of the scientific method as a strategy to ensure an approach to problems based on evidence which allows the construction of educational innovation projects, (b) education engineering focused on engineering education, which transforms the learning by developing basic, professional, and transversal skills as well as those specific for an engineer of the XXI century, and (c) interactive educational communities, both face to face and virtual, as spaces for knowledge management that support collaborative working and experience-sharing, managed by its members working together promoting initiatives to develop educational innovation projects focused on specific topics, that answer questions related to teaching and learning needs. The formulation and development of educational innovation projects are the responses to different needs identified on specific courses that are transformed into research questions. These projects aim to renew the curriculum so that it dynamically evolves based on classroom experiences. Thus, the curriculum renewal is based on critical thinking about the problems found in engineering education. The use of the scientific method and the collaborative approach enables drawing solid conclusions based on the experimental results. The model proposes the formulation and development of innovative educational projects in which scientific research applied in education aims to transform teaching, academic and administrative practices. As consequence, curricular innovations that integrate learning objects and educational, methodological and assessment strategies, are developed by an interactive learning community composed by teachers. Finally, the results obtained by applying the model in some courses in the School of Engineering of Universidad EAFIT are presented. These results include reducing the drop-out rate of students, redefining admission and graduation profiles, and micro-curricular redesign based on competences using projects, among others.", "authors": [{"name": "Alberto Rodriguez", "affiliation": "Universidad EAFIT Medell\u00edn, Colombia\u00a0"}, {"name": "Natalia A.

While multiple factors shape student experiences, the role of mentors has emerged as a critical facet. Previous mentoring research identifies functions such as role modeling, psychosocial support and career support, but little work has been done to understand how these functions are operationalized in undergraduate research experiences within engineering or how students perceive these practices. Summer research experiences, represent a unique environment because they are short-term (typically 8\u201310 weeks), highly intense (20\u201340 hours/week), and typically take students out of their home institution making the formation of mentor/mentee relationships challenging. To begin addressing this gap, this study explores student perceptions of mentoring in an interdisciplinary summer research program in water sustainability through qualitative interview data. The data set includes interviews with 20 students, gathered over two separate summers. Using a framework developed by prior researchers, the results indicate that these identified functions are valued by students, and they recognize when these functions are not adequately supplied, this encourages that exit interviews are an adequate way to assess the functions of research mentors.", "authors": [{"name": "Leigh Ann Krometis", "affiliation": "Biological Systems Engineering, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA"}, {"name": "W.

A study of the exam results identified basic mathematical problems as hindering student performance.

A novel aspect of the course design has been the integration of lecture and tutorial sessions. Homework assignments have been designed to support continuous learning using two components: One part being a review of previous tutorial sessions and the other part preparing the forthcoming lectures. The goals of these innovations are: \u2022 Students learn continuously throughout the semester \u2022 Students obtain a deep and sustained understanding of the concepts introduced in the course \u2022 Students can explain the working principles of various MOS (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) devices in different circuits Lectures were expanded by the introduction of concept questions using an audience response systems (ARS) in combination with Peer Instruction periods. This way students and teachers engaged in a feedback loop providing both, students and instructors, information about the learning status of the students. In addition, attention of students during the lectures increased. Furthermore video recordings of the lecture, student discussion forums and additional exercises and tests were made available.

The knowledge about student performance is fundamental to solve pedagogical challenges and to define different ways in teaching and learning. Following this trend, VLE provides extra information by reports, graphs and interface's alert. However, there is demand of statistical tools to support the teacher decisions, because the learning analysis is limited to frequency analysis. This paper discusses an analytical approach to deal with e-learning data. Our focus is to identify groups of learners based on their answers. Therefore, this paper pointed out some main objectives: understand profiles of answers in order to guide a student to future learning activities, and identify which criteria, in each group, is the most relevant for the tutor's help. Several techniques are useful for e-learning issues. However, we focus in Educational Data Mining (EDM) methodology. Our paper selected data of an English e-learning course from PSLC repository for case study in validation step. Preprocessing techniques of EDM were applied on selected dataset. Initially, we removed incomplete, noisy and inconsistent data of sample. After the preprocessing, we executed two steps: clustering and prediction analysis. Firstly, we executed the clustering process, because we needed to identify student's group based on their answers. After understanding the groups, we predicted behaviors of students on each cluster, which were defined in the last step. In our research, it defines that the prediction will use a regression methodology, and the clustering will execute K-means algorithm. The study identified five student's groups based on their answer, such as Expert, Good, Regular, Bad and Criticism answers. Consequently, the prediction analysis defined that the score of tutor's help (\"Avg Assistance Score\") is the most interesting factor for our investigation. The approach executed the Stepwise Backward Regression, which is a semi-automated process of building a model by successively adding or removing variables based solely on the t-statistics of their estimated coefficients. Thus, other result is that the presence of the variables \"Incorrect\" and \"Correct First Attempts\" belongs to three regression models obtained by the approach. This work's findings presents knowledge about answers profiles of VLE students in two main perspectives. First, it analyzes the usage of Open Learning Data to characterize behavioral profiles of answers using multivariate analysis techniques. Second, our analysis contributes to expand present knowledge about how student performance changes the teacher decisions in VLE. This approach tends to be a useful tool in analytical process when the VLE system does not provide statistical tools.", "authors": [{"name": "Joseana M. F. R.

Alternately, team projects may be more performance-oriented to develop students' ability to work professionally on teams.

We will consider how to design teaming experiences in thoughtful ways that respond to students' needs, interests, and constraints, as well as a particular set of outcomes. Participants will employ design thinking tools (student personas, interaction narratives) in order to explore what a team, and the individual students on the team, might experience within a given teaming framework.

The actual errors reported here are more precise, more detailed and more accurate than the diagnostic produced automatically. In order to present frequencies of actual errors, error categories were developed and validated, and student code captured at time of compilation failure was manually analysed by multiple researchers.

Often, design courses (including capstone courses) include some type of prototyping. More needs to be understood about what students need to learn from prototyping and the benefits of hands-on learning. Physical prototypes help designers by providing critical feedback on their designs. Existing literature shows the importance of prototyping in design projects, while some researchers are concerned with the design fixation caused by prototyping. In order to maximize the benefits of prototyping, it is essential to study the design thinking involved in it. This knowledge may help designers, especially novice designers and students in making decisions about which prototyping method to choose. In this study, data are collected from a realistic design project carried out by a team of professional designers. Through interviews with the designers and direct observations on the prototyping and testing cycle, the following hypotheses are investigated: (1) Building and testing prototypes helps to supplement designers' incomplete mental models leading them to better ideas and (2) Prototyping leads designers to design fixation. The results strongly support the hypotheses. Data from the current study is also compared to prior research on semester-long graduate student team projects. This prior research indicates that many unarticulated tests occur when prototypes are built and this leads to a significant number of improvements to the product. Surprisingly, this also occurred with the practicing designers. This demonstrates that the engineering design curriculum may need to adapt to better teach students to take advantage of the unexpected and students must have building skills in order to leverage this advantage. The data also show that building simple physical prototypes frequently in a design project helps to eliminate the shortcomings in initial ideas and lead designers to better ideas. In order to reduce the fixation associated with prototyping, it is essential to minimize the cost (in terms of money, time and effort) associated with prototyping. Due to the need for low sunk cost and opportunities to learn in unexpected ways from prototypes, engineering students need to have proficient building and testing skills so prototypes do not induce fixation due to sunk cost. The professional design team also did things the student design teams did not. The professional team built representational prototypes and those with selected functionalities at times. They also used strategies that likely reduce design fixation including prototyping only parts of the system and systematically used low cost materials like wood and plastic when testing physical interfaces for fit and assembly, not structural capacity.", "authors": [{"name": "Olufunmilola Atilola", "affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Julie Linsey", "affiliation": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"}, {"name": "Joseph Goodman", "affiliation": "Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, GA, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Vimal Viswanathan", "affiliation": "Mechanical Engineering Dept, Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, AL, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["buildings", "prototypes", "interviews", "solid modeling", "cognitive science", "testing", "aggregates"]}, {"title": "ROBOTRADER competition: Educating engineering students in financial markets", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2014.7044425", "abstract": "This paper describes the design and progress of the annual Robotrader competition that is organized at Telecommunication Engineering School of Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid (\u00dcPM) for university students all across Spain.

However, the broader context in which engineers work and make their ethical decisions is often overlooked. In teaching engineering students, institutional climates help define how educational programs, curricula, and pedagogical modules are designed with some values and beliefs prioritized over others. The purpose of this research was to investigate if and how institutional climate shapes the ways in which students prioritize ethical values when making ethical decisions. In doing so, we conducted a mixed-method study across four project-based engineering design programs at four different universities. Our quantitative and qualitative results revealed that institutional climate shaped the ways in which students defined, prioritized, and solved ethical problems. Students' differences in ethical reasoning across institutions may reflect the different orientations of each of the programs, such as a focus on entrepreneurialism, marketable products, or human-centered projects. This paper concludes with recommendations for effectively teaching ethical reasoning skills in the context of project-based design teams. By reflecting on institutional climate, engineering educators have to ask themselves what values are highlighted explicitly while others are overlooked in teaching ethics to students. Administrators could explore opportunities for reforming institutional climate to broaden their students' notions about ongoing ethical dilemmas beyond the priorities and valued embedded in their particular programs.", "authors": [{"name": "Patrice M.

One can determine whether students learn individual skills by measuring the error rate as a function of practice.

Unfortunately, many students enter engineering without valuing the use of diagrams in model-based reasoning. Too often, they see diagramming as something which is superfluous and disconnected from \"real problem solving.\" Students often come to their first engineering course with a well-practiced strategy that uses a rote problem solving approach in which they 1) write down the known and unknown variables they find in the problem statement, 2) search for a formula or equation that uses these variables, and then 3) enter the numbers into the formula and calculate an answer. Our first goal is to share our major research findings and our second goal is to share the learning activities we have developed and tested in our classroom. These activities increase students' motivation to use diagramming as a \"tool for thinking\" when solving complex problems. Our research shows that students can be taught to improve their diagramming skills and be more successful in both problem solving and conceptual understanding. Participants in this mini-workshop will receive a packet of materials, including full lesson plans for 5 different activities, an example diagram assessment matrix, and copies of mini-lecture slides. This activity-based mini-workshop will include mini-lectures, whole group discussion, paired work, and problem solving which will give participants the knowledge, skills, and experience needed to adapt and implement the lesson plans in their courses.

Children with disabilities provide the context for these courses, while the content remains representative of a traditional curriculum.

The newly formed groups follow an engineering process that includes gathering requirements and designing the software system. Student groups partition the work, and implement three iterations (alpha, beta, final) of their designs. Groups are re-formed, and the newly formed groups test code from each other's groups. Finally, original development groups have the ability to make final improvements to their code. Student groups are offered the opportunity to continue work on promising projects through subsequent independent studies or internships.

The core of these networks is social tagging, the act of annotating what users see in their social space. In the education domain, social tagging is potentially a useful resource to improve the organization (cataloguing) of large repositories of learning objects. To the present moment, however, many questions are open about social tagging in e-learning. In this work, hence, we proceed to answer three questions: (1) Can social tagging successfully catalog e-learning objects? (2) How do students behave according to Ko\u0308rner's classification: categorizers or describers? and (3) Does social tagging converge to a well-defined descriptive vocabulary of tags? We performed a large experiment with 336 technician students that marked 218 electronic learning objects for about 4,985 times.

While engineering problem solving strategies are useful and have their place, in many cases, they may no longer be sufficient to support the attributes of the Engineer of 2020 which supports creativity, innovation, and leadership development. Unfortunately, one cannot embrace the concept of personalized learning or develop the creativity and innovation skills that employers are seeking without also embracing the notion of intellectual diversity. While first year engineering students are intellectually diverse, graduating seniors tend to congregate towards the upper left or analytic quadrant. Individuals that are naturally more creative or innovative (upper and lower right quadrants) are much less likely to persist in the engineering curriculum. In short, the predominant analytical process found in the traditional engineering curriculum is likely to discourage budding innovators from continuing in an engineering program. In addition, while it is true that women can and often do persist in engineering, it is also true that the average typology for women is skewed downward and to the right. Consequently, without a social context or some creative outlet, women are less likely to persist in an engineering curriculum.

The consolidation of the OpenCourseWare initiative, supported by the top universities of the World, and the revolution generated in the recent years through the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses, present a new educational scenario for teachers, students and institutions. This new environment has furthered the use of e-learning, not only because of the benefits provided to students, such as flexibility of time and place, but also because anyone interested in training and learning, has access to a multitude of platforms with open resources and learning communities, not to mention the absence of admission processes or access requirements. The majority of times, this kind of courses will be the first contact between universities and students, which is of high importance regarding the prestige of the institutions. The formation of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people brings a challenge to teachers and their institutions, as they must be able to offer a course with very high quality to satisfy such a large number of students. For this reason, teachers need to develop new skills, such as managing multimedia elements or mass forums, to get an appropriate course to be published. As institutions are the final image and responsible for the courses, they must establish a process to monitor, facilitate and advise teachers to get an excellent final result. This paper shows the adaptation process that a group of teachers have developed in order to publish a course in the OpenCourseWare platform of the Technical University of Madrid. In this case, these teachers and a group of experts from the institution worked as a team to enhance the course before publishing it. As a result, the satisfaction perceived by the students who used these new materials was increased, and the published course has received a large amount of visitors as an Open Educational Resource. One of the strategic lines of the Open Education Office of the Technical University of Madrid is to promote the creation of Massive Open Online Courses from OpenCourseWare courses. This paper shows the benefits from this initiative. At this moment, the same group of teachers is developing the publication of this course as a Massive Open Online Course and many materials and multimedia resources need to be created. Besides, a new course design will be necessary to adapt the methodology to the massive conditions of the new model.
