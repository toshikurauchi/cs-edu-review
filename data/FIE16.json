Three protocols are developed by analyzing and comparing 109 high school students' design solutions to a zero-energy home design task. Lessons learned from the first two approaches informed the third approach that highlights the importance of balancing trade-offs.

The engineer who designs such a system has to take into account a variety of objectives, often contradictory, as constraints on the very ends that the design tries to accomplish. Social systems are the turf of industrial engineering, but its curriculum does not reflect this fact. The prevalent design knowledge is more about technological systems, so even the little design training that industrial engineers receive is not the one they need. This paper is about a course that aims at fixing both deficiencies by directly addressing the very weaknesses. The course, provided in the junior year, applies the PBL (problem/project based learning) style. Our lessons after eight semesters are that the industrial engineering curriculum must put much more emphasis on underdeveloped competencies such as system thinking, qualitative approach and research methods, open-ended problems solving and ambiguity tolerance.

These activities included doing extra peer reviews of classmates' work, helping other teams with their projects, writing various types of quiz questions, and answering questions on the Piazza message board.

Twenty-two teachers participated in the workshop. Instructors of the workshop were faculty members from West Virginia University Institute of Technology, West Virginia University, and West Virginia State University. The workshop's focus was project-based learning, which employs projects closely related to real-world applications to facilitate delivering abstract concepts. Specifically during the workshop, the participating high school math teachers learned designing engineering projects, mapping engineering projects to Next Generation math standards/objectives, and assessing the outcomes of project-based learning. Each participating teacher is required to implement at least one engineering project in his/her math class and the results will be collected by the superintendents of the three participating school districts. The workshop has two primary hypotheses: (i) teachers who participated in the workshop will increase their self-efficacy toward implementing project-based learning, applying engineering and technology to address content standards and objectives, and using assessments to inform instruction, and (ii) project-based learning will improve students' self-efficacy and learning effectiveness in math, and in turn, will increase their interest/intention to pursue STEM disciplines. The impact of the workshop on teachers is determined through surveys and interviews. Social Cognitive Career Theory is applied to evaluate the impact of project-based learning on the participating teachers' students. Results of the surveys, interviews, and student performance will be presented at the conference.", "authors": [{"name": "Mingyu Lu", "affiliation": "West Virginia University Institute of Technology, Montgomery, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Kenan Hatipoglu", "affiliation": "West Virginia University Institute of Technology, Montgomery, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Karen Rambo-Hernandez", "affiliation": "College of Education and Human Services, West Virginia University, Morgantown, USA"}, {"name": "Afrin Naz", "affiliation": "West Virginia University Institute of Technology, Montgomery, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["interviews", "conferences", "mechanical engineering", "standards", "training", "next generation networking"]}, {"title": "LabDuino: An open source tool for science education", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757360", "abstract": "Research shows that the poor quality of science education and related areas in the Brazilian basic education has been negatively affecting professionals training in research and scientific development, also contributes to high rates of evasion of STEM graduation courses.

The LabDuino is capable to gathering, process, show and optionally store on SD card, up to eight sensors data, promoting a hands-on experience from setting up to experiment execution in a seamless way.

Engineering entrepreneurship has evolved from the traditional business school model, focusing on business skills and business plans, to include cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset to enhance engineers' professional formation. Engineering programs are incorporating entrepreneurship into both formal and informal learning through the integration of formal courses, pitch competitions, mentorship, start-up weekends, and maker-spaces into student offerings. While it is becoming generally accepted that entrepreneurship education requires active student-learning pedagogies, assessment of student learning in relation to these pedagogies is still evolving. Of the few existing engineering entrepreneurship assessments, most have broadly assessed students' perceptions of business skills and knowledge, self-efficacy, attitude towards entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial intent. However, with the considerable amount of variance in course content and instruction, further comparative research in controlled entrepreneurship education environments is needed to accurately assess student outcomes. The recent widespread adoption of the Lean LaunchPad Curriculum and Business Model Canvas has recently provided engineering programs with straightforward, common curriculum and pedagogical approaches, as well as an opportunity for targeted assessment across institutions. Prior to the Lean LaunchPad curriculum, there was no consensus on introductory entrepreneurship content and delivery for non-business students. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and pedagogy on undergraduate students with regard to self-efficacy, behavior, and knowledge. In this study, entrepreneurial self-efficacy was measured using a validated survey from existing entrepreneurship research. Additionally, a validated entrepreneurial behavior inventory was used to assess entrepreneurial behavior, as opposed to measuring behavioral traits and attitudes. To examine entrepreneurial knowledge, students were asked to complete open-ended survey questions to determine how they would pursue a new venture at different stages of development.

The first set are collected then analyzed to compare the levels of achievement of Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) across the studied groups. ILO achievement levels are represented as EAMU vectors then used collectively in the comparison. Statistical analyses of these vectors using both Chi-square and t-tests have shown that there are no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The second data set is used to directly measure and compare a number of factors representing students' success. The obtained results for the majority of success measures denoted that there are no statistically significant differences between the two groups except for withdrawal rate and resource utilization levels which were higher in the introductory programming group.

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dynamics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics.

These criticisms are based on the fact that instruments designed for students to evaluate teaching commonly consist of the same set of generic closed-ended questions and lack the ability to appropriately judge the multi-dimensional nature of teaching and learning. Additionally, the focus of teaching evaluation is theorized to differ based on the type of institution (which are doctoral universities, baccalaureate and associate colleges).

Specifically, we use the Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) method to predict the effectiveness of software engineering teamwork learning based on data collected during student team project development. These data include over 100 objective and quantitative Team Activity Measures (TAM) obtained from monitoring and measuring activities of student teams during the creation of their final class project in our joint software engineering classes which ran concurrently at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Fulda University (Fulda) and Florida Atlantic University (FAU). In this paper we provide the first RF analysis results done at SFSU on our full data set covering four years of our joint SE classes. These data include 74 student teams with over 380 students, totaling over 30000 discrete data points. These data are grouped into 11 time intervals, each measuring important phases of project development during the class (e.g. early requirement gathering and design, development, testing and delivery). We briefly elaborate on the methods of data collection and describe the data itself. We then show prediction results of the RF analysis applied to this full data set. Results show that we are able to detect student teams who are bound to fail or need attention in early class time with good (about 70%) accuracy. Moreover, the variable importance analysis shows that the features (TAM measures) with high predictive power make intuitive sense, such as late delivery/late responses, time used to help each other, and surprisingly statistics on commit messages to the code repository, etc. In summary, we believe we demonstrate the viability of using ML on objective and quantitative team activity measures to predict student learning of software engineering teamwork, and point to easy-to-measure factors that can be used to guide educators and software engineering managers to implement early intervention for teams bound to fail.

As a part of this program, UCF STEM faculty and undergraduate researchers work collaboratively with faculty and students in the College of Arts and Humanities to create science-inspired art based on the STEM researcher's explanations of scientific concepts and possibilities. Since the program's inception in 2010, over 700 University of Central Florida faculty and students have participated in the STEAM program with a large majority coming from engineering fields. An evaluation of the program over the last six years demonstrates that by encouraging strong post-secondary cross-disciplinary collaborations, the UCF STEAM program has enlightened UCF's undergraduate engineering students in a manner that not only leads to greater recognition of the interdependencies of right- and left-brain directed skills but also has helped to improve learning and communication skills.

By integrating the arts into STEM, a four-part origami based curriculum has been developed, which combines the topics of renewable energy, architecture design, 3D CAD design and printing, and mathematic, science, and engineering principles. The modules are composed of familiar engineering education tactics to get students to think outside of the box like an engineer. Students reverse engineer origami pieces, build an origami chair using the design process, and learn the topic of renewable energies through interactive games. The final module pulls the knowledge gained from the first three together. The students design and 3D print origami structures that are energy efficient and utilizes at least one source of renewable energy. Students go through the design process with brainstorming, prototyping, and working models. The K-12 Next Generation Science Standards for science and engineering has eight practices. Origami Meets STEAM practices all eight including: (1) Asking questions and defining problems, (2) Developing and using models, (3) Planning and carrying out investigations, and (6) Instructing explanations and designing solutions.

However, only a few students disseminate their research findings in scholarly forums like refereed journals and conference proceedings. Barriers to undergraduate research publication include lack of faculty time to devote to mentoring students in writing, limited institutional funding for undergraduate research, and student's unfamiliarity with the publication process.

A pilot assessment of PubHub amongst students and faculty members indicates its usability. While resources like PubHub cannot increase funding for undergraduate researchers or shorten the timescale of the peer-review process, they can lower barriers and democratize the publication process, while refocusing faculty time on intellectual aspects of research rather than the scholarly writing process by providing students the knowledge and specific insights they need in a just-in-time manner.", "authors": [{"name": "Sarah Ritter", "affiliation": "Council on Engaged Scholarship, Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) Program, School of Engineering Design, Technology, and Professional Programs, College of Engineering, Penn State University, State College, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Rebecca Ligrani", "affiliation": "Council on Engaged Scholarship, Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) Program, School of Engineering Design, Technology, and Professional Programs, College of Engineering, Penn State University, State College, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Khanjan Mehta", "affiliation": "Council on Engaged Scholarship, Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) Program, School of Engineering Design, Technology, and Professional Programs, College of Engineering, Penn State University, State College, USA"}, {"name": "Irena Gorski", "affiliation": "Council on Engaged Scholarship, Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) Program, School of Engineering Design, Technology, and Professional Programs, College of Engineering, Penn State University, State College, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["videos", "training", "writing", "scholarships", "publishing", "engineering profession"]}, {"title": "What do first-year engineers and others consider cheating?", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757435", "abstract": "This paper reports student responses to a short survey presented within the first few weeks to a variety of first-term students including both engineers and non-engineers.

The two types of websites were Gamification (GM) and Non-Gamification (NG). While the GM website included game elements such as a Badge System, Score, Avatar, Leaderboard, Level, and Feedback (Notification), the NG website was a traditional website without game elements. In these websites, students could create their own multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and answer questions authored by classmates. The results suggest that the gamification of engineering lab activities had a positive effect in terms of motivation, engagement, and performance, indicated by the higher number of students who joined the GM website, the number of answers submitted by the GM group, the number of distinct days of participation, and the score of exam for the GM group.

However, student perceptions vary drastically as to what they perceive academic feedback to really be. Therefore, this paper aims to present freshman engineering student perceptions of academic feedback from an African perspective. The reason for targeting this group is due to their high dropout rate in higher education in South Africa (around 60%). Quantitative data was collected from freshman engineering students enrolled for a module termed Digital Systems 1 at the Central University of Technology in South Africa. A questionnaire was used as the main data collection instrument featuring 21 close ended questions. The results presented in this paper indicate that almost two-thirds (65%) of the respondents believe that a \u201cgrade\u201d written on a test script does not constitute academic feedback. The majority of the respondents (76%) expect some kind of academic feedback regarding their work, either in writing or orally from their lecturer. Another interesting result was that while most respondents (77%) wanted constructive feedback from their lecturer, just over half of the respondents (52%) felt that critical feedback is just as important as constructive feedback as it will help them to prepare for the next assessment. A good majority (86%) of students perceived that getting written comments on their assessments would encourage them to approach the lecturer to seek further clarification. A key recommendation of this study is to find a mechanism or technique of providing constructive feedback to all enrolled students, even in large classes. This needs to be done from the outset of the module in order to reduce the current high dropout rates among freshman engineering students.", "authors": [{"name": "R.B.

With the operation of the platform it has been achieved a decrease in dropout rates, and an increase in the approvals rates of the course and it has also generated a positive attitude and motivation in students towards the course. The dropouts have decreased by 21% and the approval of the course has increased by 17.2% according to official records in enrollment and students grades of the course for the period between 2011-2 and 2015 - 2.

Data rarely conforms to contrived values, so the student's ability to critically think and make decisions is of paramount importance. Since statistics is different from a traditional mathematics discipline, we feel it is necessary to differentiate instruction from a traditional mathematics class. Because statistics and data science requires considerable decision-making processes and analytical ability, we feel that elements of inquiry-based learning will be beneficial to students. These inquiry-based lessons will be provided in the form of POGIL, or Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning, activities designed to lead small groups of students through specific material within a specific subject domain.", "authors": [{"name": "Christopher Golubski", "affiliation": "Department of STEM Education, University of Texas at Austin, United States"}], "tags": ["algebra", "differential equations", "engineering students"]}, {"title": "Implementing schema-based assessment in engineering statistics courses", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757452", "abstract": "In classes like statistics, a staple for many beginning engineering students, deep interdisciplinary understanding as well as critical thinking is required to successfully learn the material. In this sense, traditional assessment, which may consist of multiple choice questions and free response problems, can be drastically inadequate to fully assess student comprehension of complex concepts. We propose a different method of assessment: schema-based items. These items are multiple choice items; however, there may be one or more correct answers based on the proposed question (hence, the items are non-dichotomous). The answer choices are nuanced and designed to measure not simply the student's understanding of a single concept but their progress on an entire learning progression, which may include a single concept as well as several adjacent ones. After some prior promising implementations of these types of assessment items, we are eager to transition these types of items to the post-secondary engineering classroom, where students are required to understand and assimilate content knowledge that is not focused on a single subject area and has a vast interconnection between subjects.

The WEX-HIL platform is capable of providing a design and test environment of virtual and real embedded system prototypes for academic research and education. The WEX-HIL platform permits a relatively quick turnaround time for software model development. The FPGA-based virtual hardware prototyping is also effectively done with the WEX-HIL platform by interfacing software models executing in the baseline real-time simulator with the virtual prototypes. Furthermore, the proposed real-time simulation platform provides a user friendly GUI-based model development environment with the commercial software IDEs from high-level to low-level and with the hardware IDEs from simulation to synthesis. The WEX-HIL platform particularly offers an ample means of integrating software and hardware models and virtual and real prototypes via high-speed wire and flexible wireless communications. The WEX-HIL real-time simulation achieved 2.89% of distance error accuracy with the sensing system, 2.5\u00d7 faster acceleration and 0.3% HIL simulation error, the 50 \u00b5s responding timing constraints, and intuitive intra and inter model and prototype integration at different abstract levels in SIL and HIL real-time simulations.

This brings a strong demand for experienced professionals worldwide, preferably graduated in Information Technology. Until the 19th century the opportunity to attend university courses was a privilege of a few undergraduates, so that the student-teacher relationship was highly personalized. In the 20th century the access to universities increased intensively in many countries, which is a very positive fact. However, it seriously compromised the personal student-teacher communication. This article presents an innovative solution to simplify generation and correction of multiple choice questions (MCQ) in which reliance on the results is wanted. With our program we obtain different issues of the same test with non-coinciding answer keys. Therefore, we offer an original, trustworthy and practical way to evaluate learning in courses attended by a large number of students. Our program generates a LATEX file and its compiled PDF file containing the individual exam of each student. The exam consists of a front page followed by a list of MCQ and optionally dissertation questions. The front page can be used as an answer sheet of the MCQ, and it has a layout that includes a header. One can opt for individual exams of which the answer keys to the MCQ is unique to each student. All these options are set in a separate configuration file. Our program uses a folder structure to organize classes of students in CSV files and databank of questions in TXT files. The students have to fill out their answer sheets of the front page, which will already contain both the student's name and her/his id number in case of individual tests. After the exam the test front pages of a class can all be scanned into a single PDF file that our software will read to perform the automatic correction. The final scores are stored in a file that contains each student's ID followed by the paired letters given.answer/answer.key of each single question. This file is in CSV format, which is both universally readable and writable by most spreadsheet programs. Our source codes are written in Python programming language. Our program is freely available on the Internet, where users can download the code in Python together with the folder structure and sample files to generate the exams. It has been intensively used at the Federal University of ABC in Brazil, both in classrooms and for distance learning courses, and also in simulations with 6772 tests with excellent results comparable with commercial products.

The College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte\u2014comprised of three departments with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1,500 students\u2014is a large research institution in an urban setting with a diverse student population. Within this unique context, the project aim is to build a sustainable practice of educational innovation across the undergraduate computing curriculum by increasing faculty awareness of teaching innovations, resources for pedagogical change, and support for teaching practices that engage students. The vision is to create an active learning environment that transforms the student entering the computing undergraduate program from a person with an interest in computing to a person with an affinity identity [1] as a computing professional through these ongoing connections. We employ a systems theory of change for the Connected Learner based on two foundational concepts: flipped classrooms and engagement theory. To achieve related goals of improving student retention and time to graduation, Connected Learner teaching strategies are being integrated across the undergraduate curriculum with an initial focus on introductory gateway courses. Change is occurring via infrastructure supports to sustain learning practices across our college through faculty development initiatives (hiring, training, mentoring, and incentives) that are designed to inform faculty about engagement pedagogies, motivate faculty to adopt these practices, and shift pedagogical attitudes. During the first year of the five-year project, quantitative and qualitative data from students and faculty was collected and analyzed. This data provides a baseline of student attitudes and performance as well as a baseline of faculty attitudes and teaching practices.

The tool contributes to the development of \u2018soft\u2019 skills essential for students' future career needs. This paper reports on a phenomenographic study that investigates the research question: What are the ways in which academics teaching Open Ended Group Projects experience teaching the course? Previous studies, using the phenomenographic research approach, have offered insights into academics' conceptions of science learning and teaching. However, there are no studies that investigate the experiences of teachers who use OEGP in their classes. This is the first study, that asks academics using an OEGP how they experience teaching these courses. Students enrolled in a course on computing education research conducted the small-scale study at Uppsala University, Sweden. In order to answer the research question, a theoretical sample was selected with a wide range of relevant population characteristics (e.g. background, prior experience, gender, and age). The semi-structured interview questions focused on understanding of OEGP, the learning objectives of OEGP, strategies for teaching these learning objectives, and the teacher's experience in teaching through OEGP. The results indicate that teachers see their role within OEGP as a coach and that the variation between experiences lies in what is intended to be coached. This variation is presented in a hierarchy (the outcome space). Categories focus on: the team, discipline, problem solving skills, learning and motivation. We also look at the first-hand experience of a student in an OEGP course and discuss the teachers' perceptions of students' experiences of OEGP. The implication for teaching is that a teacher needs to reconsider the way he or she teaches more often in OEGP than in regular courses. There are two reasons for this. First, teaching OEGP is based less on teaching content knowledge and more on teaching skills. Secondly, OEGP deals with a \u2018real problem\u2019, and aspects of the problem continuously change. Teachers are recommended to aim for reaching a higher category, indicating a deeper level of experience, and to use the experience of coaching OEGP in other courses as well. The importance of metacognition (reflection on action) and discussion with other teachers who have experience in teaching OEGP is highlighted.", "authors": [{"name": "Neena Thota", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden"}, {"name": "Marianne Voogt", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Chuan Sheng Chen", "affiliation": "Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden\u00a0"}], "tags": ["information technology", "interviews", "collaboration", "data analysis", "education", "context", "engineering profession"]}, {"title": "Providing meaningful change in the engineering classroom", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757475", "abstract": "This study aims to address how change agents assist engineering instructors in adopting new curriculum.

The model identifies three core areas of importance to computer science education: asynchronous programming, model view controller, and platform underpinnings. This framework enables mobile-specific topics like location, notifications, sensors, and more that are positioned with respect to the core areas to assist with lecture and assignment planning. Testing this model showed that students exhibited better skills and knowledge of both the core concepts and the specific topics as observed in their integration of features in term projects. This suggests that, through emphasis on core areas and repeated exposure to them in the context of new topics, students exhibit higher quality of integration of various mobile topics and deeper understand of the core-cross topic areas for mobile software development.

The second case study describes a 7th grade Health and Physical Education project in which students build models of human joints and limbs in order to understand muscle pairs.

One, the analog front-end, down-converts and samples an RF wireless signal. The other, a back-end implemented in software or digital hardware, processes the samples and recovers the transmitted information, whether it is audio, video, instrumentation data, or whatever else. An SDR transmitter performs the opposite operations. Software-defined radio has opened up tremendous education opportunities. Probably the most intriguing one is to give students the ability to experiment with actual physical signals and systems. Another benefit is that the analog front-end is flexible enough to cover a very large frequency range, allowing students to use the same device to transmit and receive a very large variety of signals. Finally, all this can be achieved without students having to design RF electronic circuits, a subject that deserves its own dedicated course. However, actually realizing the potential educational benefits promised by SDR is far from trivial. In particular, this subject has not been deeply explored in the specific context of a telecommunications engineering technology curriculum. In this paper, we offer some reflections about the experience of designing a graduate elective course on wireless communications based on SDR. We cover aspects such as prerequisites, choice of platform, and selecting appropriate educational objectives and cognitive progression. Since the digital back-end performs many functions necessary for retrieving the information from the received signal (such as carrier acquisition, symbol and frame synchronization, filtering, decimation, de-interleaving, and error control), it becomes crucial to decide how students should tackle these problems, and in which order. We also present concrete examples of student assignments that use an SDR.", "authors": [{"name": "Miguel Bazdresch", "affiliation": "Electrical, Computer & Telecom Engineering Technology Dept., Rochester Institute of Technology, NY, United States"}], "tags": ["hardware", "modulation", "software", "digital signal processing", "bandwidth", "education", "receivers"]}, {"title": "Customizing bioinformatics graduate programs for diversified student backgrounds", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757506", "abstract": "For graduate programs, usually, the curricula are developed based on the generic learning outcomes of the matching undergraduate programs. However, most graduate programs have diversified students from various backgrounds with undergraduate degrees from an assortment of majors. Even for graduate students coming from the same undergraduate majors, they might come from different countries with differing undergraduate learning outcomes. It is even more challenging for graduate programs where there are no corresponding undergraduate programs. The graduate program curriculum should be customized based on the backgrounds of special student groups. This paper will describe the redesign of our professional Bioinformatics MS program for incoming domestic and international students with diverse backgrounds. The MS students in Bioinformatics program may have a previous degree in biotechnology, computer science, biology, computer engineering, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, or other science and engineering fields. Thus, it is of great significance to categorize the program specific competencies and student learning outcomes from their previous study. It will help to customize the student specific plan of study in the Bioinformatics MS program so that they can complete the graduate study with the job-ready skills. For example, detailed studies have been carried out for the Bioinformatics related programs in India, where a substantial population of our Bioinformatics MS students comes from. In India, Bioinformatics is a growing subject and has emerged as an independent program from biomedical engineering and biotechnology. The Bioinformatics in India is taught at in all different degree levels: Bachelors, Masters, PhD, and certificates. Graduate students from India who are familiar with the Indian education system have helped to compare and contrast the various Bioinformatics related degree programs, including both Bioinformatics and Biotechnology degree programs of BS, MS, B. Tech. (Bachelor of Technology), M.Tech. (Master of Technology), M.Phil (Master of Philosophy), PhD, and integrated (such as BS+MS or MS+PhD) programs. The corresponding program competencies and the student learning outcomes are tabulated and compared. The job market in India and the USA are also analyzed. The information has been used to redesign our MS Bioinformatics program, including the alternative prerequisites, the different sequences of courses, and the diverse plans of study for students with various backgrounds. For example, some existing 3-credit introductory courses (such as Programming in Bioinformatics) are re-designed into various 1-credit common course modules (such as Programming in R, or Python, or Perl).

Over the past few decades, there have been a number of national initiatives that have promoted STEM education with the goal of generating student interest in science and engineering and increasing the number of students entering the STEM pipeline. Research literature confirms that teachers are the single most important factor affecting student achievement and interest in STEM subjects. Several models of teacher professional development have been reported along with the evidence of the degree of their effectiveness in promoting student interest in engineering. These professional development programs are designed to increase the engineering content knowledge of math and science teachers, thereby having a direct impact on student achievement in math and science and helping to promote a positive attitude to engineering. This paper presents the design of a teacher professional development program offered in a predominantly Hispanic region in South Texas. The professional development program provides an opportunity for teachers to participate in engineering projects, become more knowledgeable about the engineering profession, and learn new pedagogical tools that they use to develop engineering-based hands-on learning activities for their classrooms. One of the effective approaches adopted by this program is the development of creative engineering connections between the math and science concepts taught by the teacher participants and real-world engineering applications that not only can K- 12 students easily understand, but also find tangible and interesting. The paper also provides evidence of the effectiveness of the program strategies that have resulted in about 89% of the developed learning activities being successfully implemented in the teachers' classrooms.

While there are guidelines for identifying the best teaching style for material, new and evolving areas can present unique challenges. The emerging area of mobile software development, which combines aspects of software, hardware, and interpersonal interaction, captures many such challenges; e.g., understanding how to develop for multiple screen sizes, designing for GPS time lag, dealing with unreliable sensor data. Teaching these challenging materials seemed well suited for multiple approaches that leveraged different learning styles. This paper examines three teaching approaches employed in ten teaching modules across two semesters of a mobile software development course. The approaches included lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming. Lectures were used to introduce topics and explore underlying theories of development. The lectures included time for questions from and for the students, but otherwise did not have an active learning component. Two active learning approaches used in the class were interactive tutorials and Pair Programming. Interactive tutorials presented applied development approaches, then explored their use in an individual-based hands-on demos. Pair Programming is an agile software development practice, used in both industry and education, which enforces a role-based approach to learning new programming concepts. Homeworks were used to assess learning, and surveys reflected student satisfaction. Results show areas of promise and of concern with regard to the learning styles. It seems that repetition of topics is important for mastery of the topics. Foundational theories seem well suited for lectures, while programming concepts work better in active learning situations. Additional learning took place through office hours, online question forums, and individual and group online exploration. The findings suggest specific approaches to teaching challenging and unique mobile software development topics as well as a general approach to identifying ways to distribute learning objectives across lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming sessions.", "authors": [{"name": "Shuo Niu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Woongsup Kim", "affiliation": "Division of Computer & Information, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"}, {"name": "Mohammed Seyam", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "D.

In the spring 2016 semester this methodology was conveyed to a group of engineering students in a course titled ENGR 2002 - Professional Development. ENGR 2002 is a project-based course where students work almost exclusively in multidisciplinary teams. It emphasizes important topics that are outside the technical scope of the engineering degree, such as leadership, project management, engineering ethics, entrepreneurship, and communication. In this study, four ENGR 2002 sections acted as the control groups, where they were taught the traditional entrepreneurship content in the course and completed the same assignments as were done in previous semesters. However, two ENGR 2002 sections were taught about the LLP process and it was infused into their assignments so they could put the theory into practice. The purpose of the research was to see the impact the LLP methodology has on the quality of the assignment submissions. In order to evaluate the quality of the engineering students' work, business students trained in the LLP methodology reviewed assignments from both of the engineering student groups (the LLP and non-LLP cohorts). When performing a comparative analysis of the engineering students' submissions, there was an expectation of significantly higher quality for those that received LLP instruction and utilized the LLP methodology in their assignments. The results showed modest improvements, but more dramatic increases are expected with some pedagogical modifications. There were many lessons that were learned as a result of this study that are described in the paper. These lessons will serve as a valuable data points in future integrations of LLP in engineering courses at OU or other universities. By continuing to foster the collaboration between the engineering and business colleges at OU an increasing number of students are gaining valuable cross-disciplinary knowledge and experience that will be beneficial to them in their careers.", "authors": [{"name": "Chad E.

A nontraditional student is defined as a person who is older than 24 years of age or attends college part-time for at least part of the academic year. A traditional student is defined as a student who matriculates into a baccalaureate degree program in the summer or fall after high school graduation, is younger than 25 years of age, and pursues college on a continuous, full-time basis during the academic year. The research questions addressed in this paper are: How do nontraditional students enter the engineering curriculum? Are there differences with traditional students' entry into engineering by transfer status? Are there differences in precollege academic preparation? Is the collegiate academic performance of nontraditional students different than traditional students by transfer status? Is there a difference in the graduation or withdrawal rates between nontraditional and traditional students by transfer status? Nontraditional students are very similar to traditional students. Once students choose engineering as a major, there are no differences in mean engineering grade point average (GPA) or final cumulative GPA between nontraditional and traditional students. Nontraditional and traditional students have similar SAT scores, similar high school GPAs, choose an engineering major in similar patterns, and have similar six-year graduation rates.

This has been accompanied by a number of reports, particularly in the US, that to some extent are repetitive but in the language of the period. These reports were to a large extent based on informed opinion. These beliefs are deeply entrenched in Western Psyche and encompass beliefs about what students should learn, how they learn and how they should be taught. These views are obtained early being formed by the long experience of elementary, post-elementary and higher education and are often difficult to shift without a substantial chocs des opinions. Policy making is often made on the basis of opinion that has been informed by experience that makes itself into a self-fulfilling hypothesis that shuts out anything that is likely to create a dissonance. One consequence has been a growth of a gap between those who practice in classrooms and those who do educational research. In no other area of inquiry is the vast body of knowledge that is available on the theory and practice of education, theory taken in the broadest meaning of the term, ignored by those who make policy and practice in the classroom. It is contended here that that is morally irresponsible, and the fact that policy makers and practitioners do not have personal philosophies and theories of learning based on that world of knowledge is one of the causes of friction between these two groups. Decisions that work do so more by good luck, than good judgement. All should have received substantial training on which to build their advice, or consult with those undertaking research, and more particularly indicate research they think should be done. A not infrequent complaint is that teachers do not adapt to this or that learning strategy or use this or that particular tool (e.g. concept inventory). At the 2015 ASEE annual conference the representative of ABET lamented that academics had not used the assessment system to innovate. It is contended that innovation is unlikely in the absence of substantial prior knowledge that can enable an innovation to be progressed. It is similarly contended that the friction caused by the ABET proposals cannot be resolved without attention to knowledge that exists in the area of accreditation and assessment. The purpose of this paper is to review some of that research and scholarship as it relates to the proposition that university courses should produce graduates who are able to take up positions in industry without further training.", "authors": [{"name": "John Heywood", "affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin-University of Dublin, Ireland"}], "tags": ["reliability", "technological innovation", "training", "engineering education", "ethics", "knowledge engineering"]}, {"title": "Frontiers in education\u2014have we made a difference?

In this context one of algorithms that is often taught, is the minimax algorithm which is used in adversarial games where you want to minimize your opponent's chance of winning while maximizing your chance of winning. Different instructors use different games to make the students implement the minimax algorithm such as Checkers, Othello or Chess. However, one common problem with this assignment is that the students often spend more time implementing the game itself rather than the artificial intelligence techniques in the game. For this reason, in this paper we present a java-based open source Othello framework that was designed to be used in artificial intelligence undergraduate classes. Our framework has several features that help the students to focus on the development of the artificial intelligence aspects of the game, rather than developing the game itself. One particular feature of the framework is that it has a method that returns the list of valid moves given the current state of the game board and which player is going to make the next move. With this method, the students can focus on how to evaluate the different states using several heuristic functions and implementing the minimax algorithm. Another feature of the framework is the graphical user interface and the HumanPlayer class that allows the students to play against their own code. This feature is important as it allows the students to not only debug their codes but also to evaluate the effectiveness of their implemented heuristics. Another aspect of the framework is that it allows to set up a tournament of the codes developed by the students. The tournament can be organized in two modes. In the first mode every AI developed by one student plays against the AI developed by every other student. In the second mode, each student developed code is paired against another student developed code and only the winner plays against the winner of another pairing until there is only one winner left. An analysis of the framework in our artificial intelligence undergraduate computer engineering classes shows that it properly supports the student learning and the tournament mode also challenges them to create the best AI for Othello as they can.", "authors": [{"name": "Iuri G.

The laboratories are typically deployed in universities or research centers. A key factor of remote laboratories is that once they are available through the Internet their usage can be scaled up and used by students of other institutions. Thus, two or more institutions can share different equipment to reduce costs. Furthermore, this enables a sharing economy where multiple providers provide access to their laboratories to each other, freely or not. However, while the number of remote laboratory initiatives is high, the overall impact of these laboratories is fairly limited beyond the scope of the host institution or the scope (and duration) of projects in which the host institution is involved. The focus of this contribution is to outline a novel initiative addressing this scaling problem. After over 10 years working on the area our research group has started a spin-off focused on this topic, called LabsLand.

This paper assumes that the expansion of resources to increase the experimental practice of Chemistry can be achieved by developing virtual laboratories in a way of helping them to get involved in active learning. In this work a virtual laboratory, called VirtuaLabQ, with predefined experiments about Chemical Transformations is introduced. Also, a case study that shows the use of VirtuaLabQ integrated to hands-on laboratory is presented. The case study was performed with Engineering undergraduate students that attend the Chemical Transformation course. The main target of this study was to investigate if practicing the experiments previously in VirtuaLabQ improves the students' performance in experiments accomplished in a hands-on chemistry laboratory. Two sets of laboratory experiments were conducted, in wich students first performed online activities in VirtuaLabQ and after in the hands-on laboratory, during regular class time. Also, students answered questionnaires evaluating the performance of each experiment in virtual and hands-on laboratory. Four questions were chosen to be analyzed in order to check the main target of this work. Results indicate that the integration of virtual and hands-on experiments in a Chemistry undergraduate course assists in the good performance of students in a hands-on laboratory and can contribute to the improvement of student learning. However, improvements in VirtuaLabQ and new case studies are necessary to confirm these findings, considering, for example, other kind of evaluations that effectively compare student performance besides self-evaluation.", "authors": [{"name": "Wagner T.

Besides the technical challenges, there are safety, security, connectivity and scheduling concerns. The IEEE Education Society has formed a Working Group that is developing the Standard for Networked Smart Learning Objects for Online Laboratories (IEEE-SA P1876). Once the standard is adopted, there will be more opportunities to connect resources among universities, potentially producing distributed online laboratories. This paper looks at the design of a network of remote laboratories for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).

This creates a challenging environment to develop collaborative strategies which generate benefits to all.

To begin unpacking this underexplored concept in the engineering context, we draw on literature from psychology that conceptualizes shame as a construct of emotion with dynamics that greatly affect an individual's perceived experience. We also examine sociological perspectives on shame that attend to how this emotion exists in an intersubjective reality between an individual and his or her social context.

The present study aims at analysing the dynamics of the mental workload or stress and its impact on students' performance during an examination process. The experiment is designed using a set of multiple choice questions (MCQs) in one of the subject area namely data-structure. The MCQs are selected in three levels of complexity, which are rated by subject matter experts. A total of 13 right-handed graduate students in the specialization of Masters in Computer Application participated in the experiment. In order to get rid of any bias related to the intelligent quotient (IQ), students are taken such that the IQ varies from low to high. Experimental tasks are designed as interleaved sequences of the MCQs of varying complexity levels. During the tasks, Galvanic skin response (GSR) and pulse-oximeter (SPO2) signals are captured to estimate the stress of an individual from electro-dermal changes and heart rate variability (HRV). Apart from the tonic and phasic power of the GSR, fluctuation analysis is performed on the raw GSR signals. The standard deviation of normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) is computed to measure the HRV using the Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal obtained from the SPO2 device. An estimation of the stress level is done using a score computed by the fluctuation analysis of the GSR signal. Out of the 13 students, the GSR sensor data for the 6 students are found to erroneous and hence only 7 data are analyzed. The methodology used to reject the erroneous data is also presented. Results indicate that there is a strong statistical correlation between the complexity of the MCQs and the GSR signals.

Typically, students are instructed to perform this task through the use of tables or computer software. In this paper, we present and evaluate modules for teaching the foundations of thermodynamics using free open-source software intended to port to students' professional lives. The approach introduces the PYro thermodynamic property calculator. PYro is implemented in Python, which is free and available on most widely used platforms. PYro is clearly documented, and all data are readily traceable to reputable sources. Most of the data describe ideal gases from the NIST JANAF database, but there is also support for mixtures (such as air) and multiphase substances (such as steam). The interface design makes the software appropriate to most tasks in introductory and intermediate thermodynamics courses without requiring proficiency in the Python language. While the idea of using software to teach thermodynamics is far from new, commercial software usually comes at a substantial price and places the implementation burden on the instructor. On the other hand, educational software rarely transitions into students' professional lives. This paper proposes a model for productively separating the development of skills (like table look-ups) from knowledge and concepts. In addition to an introduction of the tool, this paper provides results of preliminary evaluation conducted within a thermodynamics classroom. The authors developed a learning module demonstrating the use of PYro to compute states for an ideal Brayton cycle. Students were tasked with performing parametric analysis on the cycle, by varying various limiting factors (e.g. combustor pressure, turbine inlet temperature). Students were asked to compare power produced and cycle efficiency computed under these conditions. At the end of the module, students were surveyed about the experience of working with the software. Evaluation is provided in the form of instructor and student feedback from a classroom implementation. We propose that this utilization of the tool demonstrates its ability to promote higher-level cognitive thinking in problem solving, removing the time intensive task of performing table look-ups and allowing them to focus on more holistic questions of cycle performance.", "authors": [{"name": "Jacob P.

As engineering educators, we pride ourselves not only in developing technical experts, but in developing diverse thinkers and innovators ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow. Arguably, the most critical point in problem-solving at this level is the ability to interact with a wide variety of information. It allows for understanding goals, identifying scope, and setting assumptions. Thus, we believe that a greater exposure to different avenues of working with information can lead to more robust problem-solving skills, and should be considered in our coursework development. It is essential that our students leave our programs with not only high degrees of content knowledge, but also the comfort and ability to engage with information. We give great credence to the diversity and difficulty of unforeseen future societal challenges, yet our curricula does not fully represent this. Realistic problems are often open-ended, ambiguous, and/or have multiple solutions, making them difficult to incorporate into 15-week courses. However, there may be other ways to promote diversity of problem-solving skills through avenues better suited for our current academic system. We have developed a method of categorizing problems based on learning style biases\u2014learning styles exploited in the problem solution or presentation\u2014that allows instructors to check how they are asking students to engage with information to solve problems. Our previous work suggests that most instructors favor highly homogeneous problem types, and that certain styles are neglected in course experiences. While learning styles remain a controversial topic in education, we believe this application is a perfect example of their potential use for positive impact in engineering education. Learning styles define how individuals interact with information\u2014how they receive, perceive, process, and understand information. This makes learning styles a well-suited tool for evaluating and improving upon our current practices and the extent to which we task our students with solving diverse problems. We have developed a set of criteria, based on the Felder-Silverman model of learning styles, which allows instructors to quickly evaluate presentation and solution biases in their coursework (problems, projects, etc.) and easily assess whether they are providing students diverse opportunities to engage with information. We believe that the more learning styles students are exposed to through problem presentation and solution, the more robust their problem-solving skills will be, as they will readily be able to receive, perceive, process, and understand information presented or utilized in a variety of ways. This methodology is less concerned with students' own preferences, but rather, focuses on creating a \u201cbalanced\u201d course experience with respect to learning styles (irrespective of student preferences). The criteria can be used both for assessment of existing problems, and development of new problems. We believe that adoption of methods such as these to assess and reevaluate our curricula can further propel us along the path of developing the engineers of the future.", "authors": [{"name": "Elif E.

In an educational setting, most peer assessment consists of a single round. The problem with this setting is that, either the authors do not have a chance to update their work, which makes the suggestions from their peers useless, or the author can make changes after receiving the peer reviews, which forecloses using peer review to help assign grades. To address these issues, in our classes we now use two rounds of online review, with a different rubric for each. Our Expertiza peer-review system allows the evaluation rubric to vary by rounds. In the first review round, we present a formative review rubric to the peer reviewers. In the formative rubric, we try to encourage student reviewers to look into details, point out the problems they can find in the author's work, and offer insightful suggestions. After the formative review round, authors have the opportunity to submit an updated version of their artifacts. Next comes a summative peer-review round, using a summative rubric.

This quality control is costly and has limited the adoption of peer teaching in schools. Our solution to this problem is to ask students to create pedagogical material that will then be evaluated by the students themselves, where they evaluate a mix of new and already rated materials. One advantage of this technique is that it allows students to develop critical thinking skills, since they must judge if the presented material adequately covers a specific topic. We describe the \u201cTeaching is Learning\u201d project, that implements these ideas. We first discuss two pilot studies: 1) since 2009, engineering students from the University of Chile have been creating and validating pedagogical 3D animations; and 2) during 2015, seventh graders from the Blest Gana secondary school created and evaluated pedagogical videos using their cell phones, editing the videos during their Technology class.

Comparing these two types of systems, e.g. on rating accuracy, or usefulness of formative feedback, can be challenging because researchers need to learn the design and terminology of each system before analyzing the data.

Recent advances in technology encourage a re-examination of ways that technology can support and expand groupwork. This paper examines how large multi-touch tabletop displays can be used by students in group information exploration, creation, and sharing situations. The multi-user, multi-touch features enable multiple people to transition between individual and group interactions with the display, rather than the turn-taking interactions common in older technologies. While this provides opportunities, it also presents challenges in the ways that activities for the shared space are crafted, executed, and evaluated. This paper describes how our software solutions encourage idea exchange, sharing, and awareness of the activities of others, toward crafting better artifact-centered educational experiences. Specifically, the paper describes three techniques for card-based explorations that help enable groupwork: semantic zoom, dynamic grouping and info glow. Semantic zoom considers how pinch zooming can vary not only artifact size but also artifact content, showing more information at larger sizes. Dynamic grouping features the card combination which facilitates idea generation and synthesization. Info glow highlights artifacts that have been recently accessed or changed, providing an enduring way to see modifications made by others. This paper explores usage of this environment and these techniques, focusing on their impacts on educational goals and objectives for K-8 and for undergraduates, to understand how students in pairs or triads work independently and together as they explore and create within information spaces. Results suggest that older students tend to engage more with each other, though students of all ages transition between quiet individual work and communicative group work.

Do they teach to the average student and hope the less experienced keep up and the more experienced are not bored? The first step to answering these questions is to determine the distribution of experience. To assess this, first-year engineering students at Michigan Technological University were given the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) Computer Access and Familiarity Survey (Grade 12) during their first week of classes. The NAEP survey measures access to and familiarity with technology. The survey was modified to measure the familiarity with computing tasks students use in their first engineering courses.

The second element is focused on the development of a novel open source platform for automatic control, whose aim is to help to improve the educational process of the students in this area. The educational concept of the platform is based on cooperative learning methodology, in which the students collaborate with the platform design according to their needs and expectations. This methodology allowed to know initially the points of view of the students with the aim to establish the perspectives, motivations, skills and weaknesses of them in the automatic control area as well as in the different technical subareas needed in the design of the platform such as programming or signal conditioning. In agreement with the cooperative learning methodology, the construction of the platform was divided in small tasks with objectives clearly defined associated to the learning of the different educational contents in the components of hardware and software needed in the design of it. Our students interacted with each other, sharing common issues and difficulties associated with the technical behavior of the platform. This process increased the group motivation so as to find common aims both technical and human as likewise it encouraged the creativity in search of technical solutions in the design of the platform.

The use of Learning Objects (LO) has gained ground in higher education, but few experiments have been developed to help teach programming concepts to students in the early years. In other experiments, we applied the use of LO in the teaching of programming concepts.

Therefore, in 2015 we conducted a new experiment with two groups of students, using a LO to teach Sorting concepts.

On average around 20 students enroll in this project-based course and 72% of their grade depends on three comprehensive group projects, one of which is to design a bone plate for a fractured femur. 6% of the grade comes from an individual application presentation, discussing different circumstances in which the concepts in mechanical engineering can be applied to solve/analyze biomedical problems. Background of physiology is introduced in the class while the majority of applicable engineering knowledge was learned in prerequisite courses, such as statics, dynamics, strength of materials, system dynamics, etc. Finite Element Analysis (FEA), an elective offered in both semesters of senior year, is not a prerequisite for this bioengineering course. Most of students enrolled in our bioengineering course either do not have FEA course or are taking FEA concurrently. Therefore in spite of its popularity in the areas related to biomechanics, thus far FEA has not been incorporated in this bioengineering course. Previously, the fractured femur project utilized the applicable theoretical analyses including those from statics, strength of materials, materials, and machine design. In Fall 2015, the instructor of bioengineering course made an effort to have an FEA study on femur and ensuing presentation be completed by a willing student. This student was taking FEA simultaneously with bioengineering, and was scheduled to present during the last week of semester. The instructor of FEA wrote an introductory manual of FEA procedures to analyze a healthy femur using a CAD model of the femur. Then the student used the manual to initiate the FEA study of the fractured femur. A major challenge to the student was the complicated loading and assembly feature of the bone plus the addition of bone plate. After a several week struggle and independent learning, while guided by the faculty members of bioengineering and FEA, the student was able to accomplish the FEA analysis and presented the results to the class. The discrepancy between FEA results and theoretical analysis was shown to be less than 5% in most results. The presentation also included FEA results for a diverse realistic loading and boundary conditions. Since all students had finished the fractured femur project, they actively participated in a meaningful discussion after the presentation. The completion of this project demonstrated the feasibility and importance of incorporating FEA in our bioengineering course. In addition, the presenting student was able to complete a working manual for the FEA analysis of the fractured femur, which can be passed to the future students of this course. A plan is to include FEA in the project as a bonus activity, and regarding the formation of project teams, the instructor would appoint a member who is enrolled in the FEA course.

Analysis resulted in an emerging relationship between assessment and a behavior we call externalization. We observe a co-occurrence between externalization and problem-set-related assessment; the co-occurrence indicates that some students may not feel as though they have control over their progress and performance on problem sets and it is this lack of control that the students report to be frustrating and amotivating. Additionally, we observe that blame is presented either as externalization or non-externalization while credit is almost always non-externalized. The two presentations of blame suggest that students might externalize to cope with negative affective experiences.

Comparative analysis is conducted between JavelinaCode and programming environment tools, including BlueJ, Jeliot 3, AguiaJ, JIVE, and jGRASP. Each of these tools is evaluated on the basis of time constraints for download and installation, complexity of the download process and tool's interface, and the provision of static and dynamic visualizations. The results of the comparative analysis show that JavelinaCode provides students with a more effective tool for understanding OOP concepts than those considered. This is due to a simplified set up process and user interface and a better integrated set of visualizations. The combination of these factors contributes to a programming environment that emphasizes developing and running code.", "authors": [{"name": "Brandon Earwood", "affiliation": "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Young Lee", "affiliation": "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, USA"}, {"name": "Jeong Yang", "affiliation": "Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Texas A&M University-Kingsville, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["dynamic programming", "linux", "unified modeling language", "visualization", "programming profession", "programming environments"]}, {"title": "Impact of collaborative learning on student perception of virtual computer laboratories", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757640", "abstract": "In the last decade, virtual computer laboratories have been successfully used to provide students with hands-on experimentation in information technology fields in a cost effective and secure manner. In this paper, we study the effect of collaborative learning on student perception and acceptance of virtual computing as a learning medium. Virtual computing is a relatively new technology and can be intimidating for students at times with limited information technology background. Students can feel overwhelmed as they follow voluminous and tedious step-by-step information technology activities that are not very familiar to them. Collaborative learning can help to alleviate such problems and enhance the student experience of using a virtual computer laboratory in different ways. To investigate the effect of collaborative work on student experience in virtual computer laboratories and their acceptance of this new technology, we conducted empirical studies where two groups of students (with technology and non-technology backgrounds) performed two types of hands-on activities. These types were individual and collaborative in nature and were conducted in a virtual computer laboratory. Then, we compared the experiences of the two groups across the types of hands-on exercises. The preliminary findings show that novice students benefited more from collaborative learning when compared to more experienced, and probably more technologically competent, students.", "authors": [{"name": "Mahdi Nasereddin", "affiliation": "Information Sciences & Technology, Penn State Berks, Reading, USA"}, {"name": "Sadan Kulturel-Konak", "affiliation": "Management Information Systems, Penn State Berks, Reading, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Abdullah Konak", "affiliation": "Information Sciences & Technology, Penn State Berks, Reading, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Michael R.

We recreated this work using a new, large data set (63,012 students over 10 years) of student performance, and found that the initial results held when using the original approach. We argue that there are methodological shortcomings to the original approach, however, as there is no attempt to control for individual student program difficulty (STEM majors and non-STEM majors share some classes, but have very different overall suites of courses that determine their overall GPA). As the female/male and racial ratios vary across majors it is therefore likely that a division by gender is not comparing equivalent sample populations.

The perspectives of the youth show a lack of gender related trait association. After all different levels of contact, research area association with ECE was expanded.

The dependency on formulae is so pervasive that it qualifies to be classified as an addiction i.e., formulae addiction labeled in this paper as \u201cformulaholic\u201d and defined as \u201cthe compulsive dependency on formulae to solve analytical problems to the subdual of critical thinking skills\u201d. This formulae driven trait in these students results in poor performances in analytical-based courses. It also often leads to their lack of engagement in engineering classrooms. This problem is especially of critical concern in HBCU environments. In order to address this concern, the researchers are currently implementing a constructivism-infused peer learning approach for incoming engineering students. In this approach, the incoming freshmen are enrolled in specially designed peer-group tutorials that guide the participants to collectively solve problems by themselves. The performance of the students attending these tutorials was compared with a control group. The results showed that the students who attended the peer group tutorials performed significantly better in their class tests and analytical-thinking skills compared to the control group. Currently, the progress of these students is tracked through their engineering classes. Based on the feedback from the participating students, they found the group-learning method very effective. Further, they unofficially get together with their groups frequently to study for their exams in other classes.

Students are informed about expectations and guidelines to become engaged in the course, to understand its support structure (e.g, office hours, peer-led mentoring, homework format, note taking, time management, online assessments, building communities, and others), and to take responsibility for their own educational success. As part of the course grade, students are accountable to implement best study practices by maintaining a well-organized course binder and using services such as peer mentoring and office hours, and to follow guidelines to keep up in the course. An online survey to determine students' judgment about the importance and impact of the guidelines, expectations, and engagement activities in the gatekeepers was implemented and the results are presented in this paper.

These systems are increasingly connected with both private and public networks, making them susceptible to disruption or destruction by adversaries anywhere in the world. Attacks such as the Stuxnet worm have highlighted CPS vulnerabilities and motivated the development of CPS-specific defenses. The lab modules described in this paper arose from a project initially focused on technology to counter a Stuxnet-class attack on a CPS, and the suitability of this technology's commercial off-the-shelf components for undergraduate education was later realized. CPS security is not given much attention in undergraduate programs because networks and control systems are traditionally distinct areas of study. We have developed hands-on courseware to show how an adversary can compromise a CPS in a Stuxnet-like manner by tunneling through a layered sequence of network protocol and interface weaknesses. The courseware incorporates cyber-physical security concepts into effective learning modules that highlight real-world technical issues. This modular learning approach helps students understand CPS architectures and their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks via experiential learning, and acquire practical skills through actively participating in the hands-on exercises. This courseware uses an economical and easily replicable hardware testbed, making this experience available as an adjunct to conventional embedded system, control system design, or cybersecurity courses. To assess the impact of this courseware, an evaluation survey is developed to measure the understanding of the unique aspects of CPS security.

Very few systems consider a learning theory as theoretical framework. Only two out the 16 learning principles are supported by existing visualizations.

This approach enables the student to more easily apply this basic knowledge to understand other antenna types. We start with the resonant half-wave dipole that when energized produces a periodic current and voltage standing wave (SW) along the wire. The two are out of phase such that at the center feed point, the current is a maximum and voltage is a minimum and thereby the transmission line sees a pure resistance of 73 ohms. To illustrate the current standing wave, we divide the two quarter wave sections into several pieces then series connected using incandescent light bulbs. We then energize the dipole, causing the bulbs to light where the brightness varies as a function of the current magnitude, the ones closest to the feed point have maximum brightness, the bulbs toward the ends less so. Hence the students are given a visual experience of the current SW profile. This is extremely profound since the students see that there is indeed a displacement current which causes the bulbs to be illuminated even though the dipole ends are not terminated. This also conveys to them that circuit theory is not adequate to explain radio frequency phenomena (i.e. current only flows through a load if there is a return path). From this, the student can readily grasp why the feed impedance is 73 ohms, why the radiation pattern is donut shaped, why the dipoles can work at multiple bands and the operation of other SW antennas.

We firstly analyze the five problems in the system according to the feedback from the teachers and students: 1) logical errors in students programs cannot be located; 2) a cheating that directly outputs answers cannot be detected; 3) evaluation results lack statistics and visualization; 4) the code submitting procedure is complicated; 5) the feedback of incorrect answers is not detailed. In order to solve these problems, we employ a fault localization algorithm, revise the evaluation logic, introduce third-party visualization plug-ins and refactor the system, respectively.

In developing the Engineering Student Identity Survey (E-SIS), our research team administered the survey to four cohorts of engineering students to investigate whether the E-SIS could differentiate, in predictable ways, the salience of engineering identity across cohorts. The measured constructs were derived from extensive theoretical underpinnings in social identity theory (i.e. interest, unified self-concept, sense of belonging, self-enhancement, participation, distinctiveness, social support, in-group cooperation, citizenship behavior, visibility of affiliation).

Such educational contexts are complex and we have found it necessary to scaffold student learning using agreements based on professional competencies. This has led to a pedagogical framework, which has found successful application in a number of contexts. This framework has been built based on discussions with students, and has involved the development of a supporting wiki which contains descriptions of the different professional competencies involved in the learning agreement.

We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers.

The New Zealand educator John Hattie introduced a meta-study called \u201cVisible Learning\u201d in which he mentions feedback to be one of the major factors affecting the success of learning. However, its influence on fundamental programming tasks cannot be investigated properly unless objective, reliable and valid tasks exist that allow a clear inference of the observed performance for the given feedback. For example it would be possible to argue that observed educational \u201cimprovements\u201d are in fact the result of a reliability or validity problem. Since tasks for programming fundamentals were often created intuitively, it had to be explored how to get objective, reliable and valid tasks.

In this paper, we focus on measuring aspects of code that instructors usually assess in programming assignments which are deemed unmeasurable: qualitative aspects that go beyond functional correctness. The aim of this work is to produce richer feedback messages that go beyond functional correctness as it involves code quality issues. We found that if an instructor is required to produce a reference solution for a programming assignment, then most of the expectations the instructor has about a student's code quality are concretely present in the reference solution. Based on this idea, we proposed and evaluated a set of candidate quality measures using the assignment's reference solution as a baseline. The results showed that they seem to capture what is usually considered to be the subjective and qualitative aspects of an instructors' assessment.

The results proved that there were positive correlations between TIs and the quality of writing comments that affect on improving the prediction results.", "authors": [{"name": "Tsunenori Mine", "affiliation": "Dept. of Advanced Information Technology, Kyushu University, Japan"}, {"name": "Shaymaa E.

The basis of our previous experiments is an instructor chooses a set of twenty words used within the course that will be the set of words to test in mind maps. The instructor then creates their own mind map with this set of words, which is called the criterion map. Next, students create their mind maps using the same twenty words, and the criterion map and student map are analyzed with each other using various algorithms to produce metrics that quantify how similar the two maps are. When this activity is repeated longitudinally over a semester we can show that students are learning if their metrics of similarity are improving over time. One challenge, however, is which twenty words should be selected by the teacher. Similarly, will the set of twenty words impact the quality of observed learning. In 2011 and 2012, we collected our mind map data based on twenty words selected with no methodology (random). In 2013 and 2014, we created a methodology where approximately forty words are initially chosen, and these forty words are reduced down to 20 by creating a larger mind map and picking the words that have low connectivity. The hypothesis here is that less connectivity in the mind map will make it easier for the student to create their own quality maps. Our results show that this new methodology improves the arithmetic average of one of our best comparison metrics for all data points by a worse case of 2.4% better and best case 75% better.", "authors": [{"name": "Chris Bell", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Peter Jamieson", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA"}, {"name": "Ryan Sunderhaus", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Amber Franklin", "affiliation": "Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["electronic mail", "vocabulary", "computers", "measurement", "joining processes", "cats", "market research"]}, {"title": "Teaching programming as application development from the ground up", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757738", "abstract": "This paper explores the proposition that teaching programming for application development differs from established methods in computer science, engineering, and MIS, and requires a re-framing of pedagogical models. In addition to programming fundamentals, algorithms, and data structures, application development also requires understanding the foundations of human-computer interaction and the nature and economics of information in different application domains. Tradeoffs to make this possible within a four-year undergraduate degree are explored using a revised version of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives to compare learning objectives for an applications developer curriculum with those for a traditional computer science curriculum. The paper also reports our experiences over the last five years with a new application design and development curriculum in the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) at Penn State University. Faculty and student backgrounds and interests range from business to social sciences to humanities to engineering and computer science. Students entering the major have diverse educational backgrounds different from students typically entering physical science, engineering, or computer science programs. We elaborate on these differences and discuss this new curriculum developed to focus more directly on the requirements of application development where they differ from those in numerical or systems-oriented programming.", "authors": [{"name": "Steven R.

To assess student learning, we used three exams and the Signals and Systems Concept Inventory. The results showed that students in the lecture classroom outperformed their peers in the active classroom on midterm 1 but scored lower on midterm 2. No difference was found in performance on the final exam and the concept inventory.

In this paper, we propose a data and metadata model for Learning Analytics applications using data from LMS. This model is LMS independent and supports Business Intelligence and Data Mining applications for decision-making in the educational context. Our model considers the use of historical data from LMS treated under three perspectives that can be analyzed individually or correlated. The model also allows analysis considering different stakeholders (student, educator, etc.) and levels of granularity (institution, department, course, discipline, etc.). In this sense, the proposed model allows consistent and correlated analysis of data from LMSs.

The goal of the modeling is to test students' technical and spatial abilities while connecting the modeling to the greater good. The SolidWorks modeling takes place in a 4000-level (senior) SolidWorks elective course where students become certified at the SolidWorks Associates Level. Team members from the Toy Adaptation Program (TAP) at The Ohio State University came into the class to discuss the purpose of their program and their work, which includes adapting toys for children with special needs. This need served as the background for a semester-long modeling project. Through the partnership, students now model toys that are adapted by the TAP.

The effect of allowing live-streaming was analyzed by running an experiment where partway through the semester students in a flipped advanced level Computer Graphics class were given the option to attend the class remotely using a live-stream of the class with required use of a multi-featured audience response system (TeachBack). The results show that allowing remote attendance with TeachBack decreased the number of students attending physically from 93% to 75% of registered students and had no effect on unexcused absences. Students believed that their remote attendance was just as effective for their learning as attending classes face-to-face and analysis of the data confirmed their beliefs; they did however generally prefer being physically present in class. Our results suggest that appropriate use of live-streaming coupled with an Audience Response System can reduce some of the demand for large lecture halls by allowing a self-selected subset of students to attend some or all of the classes remotely. A large percentage of the students in the class felt that a live-streaming option should be added to most classes and this paper demonstrates that this goal is feasible and pedagogically justifiable.", "authors": [{"name": "William T.
