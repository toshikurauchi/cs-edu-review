These four features include: peer-scaffolding, learning-in-practice, distributed expertise, and engineering-specific writing. Findings from student interviews and focus groups, as well as classroom observations, show that student learning and engagement are positively impacted by class activities that are constructed with an emphasis on small-group social interaction and participation in authentic engineering tasks.", "authors": [{"name": "Erika Mein", "affiliation": "College of Education, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas\u00a0"}, {"name": "Christina Convertino", "affiliation": "College of Education, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas\u00a0"}, {"name": "Angelica Monarrez", "affiliation": "College of Education, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas"}], "tags": ["robots", "engineering education", "context", "collaboration", "writing", "interviews"]}, {"title": "Qualitative assessment of the University of Texas system Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Summer Research Academy Abroad: An international experience in research and culture", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344038", "abstract": "Since 1993 nine universities in the University of Texas System and several affiliated community colleges have worked collaboratively to promote STEM undergraduate research through the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.

Each participating institution begins its work with a process of documenting resources (assets) and identifying gaps at their school to create a \"landscape analysis.\" That analysis then becomes the basis for identifying well-defined objectives for focused work to create meaningful change over a short period. The mapping process itself becomes a vehicle through which a large number of stakeholders throughout the institution are engaged. While this process of asset mapping is well-referenced in change literature, its application to curricular change is novel. The specific objectives of the Epicenter project are to increase the access to innovation and entrepreneurship learning opportunities for undergraduate engineering students; however, aspects of the landscape analysis process are relevant to a much wider audience of faculty and administrators seeking to implement curricular change beyond one instructor and/or one course.

We argue that the incorporation of experiences on mutation testing in programming courses adds valuable knowledge to the learning process.

We present results of experiments and analysis involving undergraduate students. These experiments are the continuation of a previous work in which we raise empirical evidences that the adequate incorporation of mutation testing in programming courses contributes to form an effective environment that fosters learning. To do so, we provide a mutation testing tool to promote the practice of mutation testing by novice programmers. Through practical experiences and several analysis survey we measured the effects of using the mutation testing criterion to teach programming. In addition, we collected the opinion of senior students who already knew mutation testing concepts about their opinion on the usage of mutation concepts to teach novice programmers. Our findings reveal that the effective use of mutation analysis concepts contributes to the learning process, making students see the code as a product under development that is the result of a careful manual coding process which they need for measuring and predicting the effect of each command.

It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills.

A malicious insider is a person who violates an authorized level of access in a software system. Unfortunately, when creating software, developers do not typically account for insider threat. Students learning software development are unaware of the impacts of malicious actors and are far too often untrained in prevention methods against them. A few of the defensive mechanisms to protect against insider threats include eliminating system access once an employee leaves an organization, enforcing principle of least privilege, code reviews, and constant monitoring for suspicious activity. At the Department of Software Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology, we require a course titled Engineering of Secure Software and have created an activity designed to prepare students for the problem of insider threats. At the beginning of this activity, student teams are given the task of designing a moderately sized secure software system. The goal of this insider is to manipulate the team into creating a flawed system design that would allow attackers to perform malicious activities once the system has been created. When the insider is revealed at the conclusion of the project, students discuss countermeasures regarding the malicious actions the insiders were able to plan or complete, along with methods of prevention that may have been employed by the team to detect the malicious developer. In this paper, we describe the activity along with the results of a survey.

Yet, despite the substantial investment in human resources and capital dedicated to the construction of PBL learning studios, there was little to show for the investment. There was a relatively little increase in popularity in attracting greater number of students to engineering at VU, which in terms of attractiveness remaining lowest in the packing order among engineering education providers in Melbourne. The proportion of girls selecting VU engineering as their course of study remained low. Surveys taken since 2008 among second year engineering students were part of a study to determine students' perceptions and motivations for choosing engineering as their course of study, and choosing VU engineering. The study hoped also to explore the effect PBL had on popularity of studying engineering at VU. This is the subject of this paper. The survey results revealed a mixed-bag. There was some good news. Over the seven years, the awareness of PBL at VU amongst final year secondary students has risen. More students indicated that knowledge of PBL would be more likely to attract them to VU engineering than act as a disincentive. It must also be noted that almost half of students were neutrally disposed towards PBL. Despite the liking PBL pedagogy, large proportion of students felt preferred the subject delivery was to be done in more traditional pedagogies. It suggested that students liked constructivist approaches within a more accessible framework. The relative high proportion of students indicating their desire to transfer to another university or course is a concern and needs to be addressed by the curriculum planners.", "authors": [{"name": "Josef Rojter", "affiliation": "College of Engineering and Science, Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia"}], "tags": ["australia", "investment", "engineering students", "standards", "knowledge engineering"]}, {"title": "Using Peer-Led Team Learning to build university-community college relationships", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344094", "abstract": "Through support from the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the El Paso Community College (EPCC) began a program to collaborate on adoption of Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) at EPCC.

Unlike other science fields, few students are routinely exposed to programming in the K12 system. This can make the freshman programming course daunting. However, in the field of software engineering, success in this area is vital, as success in nearly all future courses requires mastery of this skillset. In the engineering field, we find that many students are visual learners. These students learn best by seeing, and they can perform very well in the classroom with the appropriate usage of teaching styles. However, when it comes to providing feedback to students on submitted assignments, the main method employed is the written comment, which is not conducive to visual learners. From a faculty member's standpoint, this makes sense, as it is the simplest form of feedback. However, written feedback is often ineffective at improving student performance, as many students simply do not read the comments because the students feel they are not relevant to their performance. This can be compounded in the freshman year, as students are still learning what is meant to be an effective college student. At higher levels, an alternative feedback mechanism, namely asynchronous multimedia feedback, has shown great promise. In lieu of written feedback, students are provided feedback for software engineering exercises through the use of a short video made via video capture. The video captures in multimedia format the instructor's perceptions and actions when grading a given assignment. The video shows, in real time, what the instructor saw, whether it is a program crashing or the successful operation of the program. Furthermore, it provides the instructor the ability to potentially fix simple blatant errors and see the instructor's debugging strategy. The article describes the pedagogical foundation for the technique, specifics of the technique used, student perceptions of the technique, and an assessment of the learning gains from using such a method in an introductory freshman programming course. In general, students are show to prefer the technique versus traditional grading, and a statistically significant improvement in overall outcomes for the experimental course is shown to exist. A statistically significant correlation between the watching of videos and outcomes is also shown.", "authors": [{"name": "Walter W.

The ability to develop software at remote sites provides means to utilize talents and skills in different parts of the world. Organizations and companies benefit from such diverse pool of developers. Recently, global software engineering courses started to be popular in academic settings to prepare generations of developers who can function in a professional way in such distributed setting. Courses are normally offered as part of computer science or software engineering degrees. There are different challenges pertaining to team members, environment and the interlacing factors like time zones, cultural diversity of team members, location barriers and gender issues. Simulation games have been used to teach classical software engineering courses. Simulation games can be used to illustrate and experiment with concepts like team management, performance and tool selection. SimSE is an educational simulation tool that provides graphical simulation environment to help students to practice anticipated challenges during software development. In this paper, we propose a model for distributed global software development simulation games. The model includes factors like time zones, cultural diversity of users (mainly Hofstede's culture dimensions are used), location barriers and gender issues.

The proposed cycle consists of seven steps on which gamification theory and ABET criteria are combined. It arose from the adaptation of a gamification design framework, commonly used in industry, into the specific context of high quality education in engineering. It is formulated at high level. Consequently, it should be useful for practitioners having different requirements and expectations. A developed practice, following the proposed cycle, is presented, discussed and evaluated. In particular, the proposal is applied and exemplified, in a scenario for teaching introductory concepts of computer programming in a first-year course. A digital game was used within a gamified learning experience, as a teaching tool. However, the learning process does not rely solely on the use of the game by itself. Moreover, the devised scenario has a purpose beyond edutainment: contributing to achievement of student outcomes, under a continuous improvement approach, according to ABET. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the developed practice was performed. A positive impact on students' emotional engagement and behavior was observed as a result of the evaluation process.", "authors": [{"name": "Ivan Cabezas", "affiliation": "Laboratorio de Investigaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo de la Ingenier\u00eda de Software - LIDIS, Universidad de San Buenaventura, Cali, Colombia"}], "tags": ["accreditation", "industries", "proposals", "context", "games", "continuous improvement"]}, {"title": "Is there a gender difference in Maths competencies achievement between Aerospace Engineering students in Spain?", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344112", "abstract": "The NSF has recently issued the report on \u201cWomen, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering\u201d which provides statistical information about the participation of these three groups in science, engineering education and employment.

In fact, the lack of effective teamwork has been identified among the most important factors contributing to the high failure rate of complex engineering projects. In this paper, we focus on engineering students' attitudes toward teamwork, their self-efficacy and interest in teamwork knowledge, skills, and abilities. Self-efficacy in a domain is an important construct that can predict whether or not someone is willing to undertake a challenge in that domain. Research suggests that the sufficient level of self-efficacy can encourage personal growth and skill development. The relevant research also points out that interest is a construct that can predict students' professional development in a domain. For example, as someone becomes an expert in a domain, his/her interest in the domain becomes individual, which means there is a long-term personal connection resulting in further exploration of the domain. In this paper, we postulate that the development of students in teamwork knowledge, skills and abilities can be tracked by the progress in their teamwork interest. In addition, we argue that interest development should be measured as a part of the assessment efforts to evaluate the professional skills development of students. We have developed and validated an instrument to measure teamwork efficacy and interest. The instrument was used to collect data in a geographically distributed university. The collected data were analyzed to identify the factors affecting students' attitudes toward interest and self-efficacy in teamwork as well as their relationships.

A modified colour based Tetris (similar to Stroop test) game is used for the said purpose. A comparative study is done between the offline questionnaire based and the physiological signal based flow measurements.

In addition, no standardized methods are provided to evaluate and control the computational complexity of generated problems. General concepts of complexity in various forms can be found in standard textbooks. The authors treat a different flavor of complexity, subjective complexity, where complexity is measured by the difficulty that learners feel. The authors proposed a new framework for evaluating computational complexity from learners' view, aiming to apply our framework to automatic generation of college math problems with controlled computational complexity. To prove the effectiveness of the new concept of complexity from learners' perspective, we developed some automatic generation tools based on our framework. In this paper, we will present one of the tools that supports automatic generation of eigenvalue problems. Controlling the complexity of eigenvalue problems involves restricting the number of calculation steps, the heights of the involved rationals, and the algebraic number fields appearing in the model solution of the problem. The small-scale experiments showed the relevance of our framework. Our system makes a path to strict quantitative control on various complexity from the learners' view.

Considering the need for changes in the MOOC's pedagogical model, this research aimed to investigate and promote a reflection about the possibility of using Flipped Classroom Teaching Model principles to design this type of virtual and massive environment. The paper starts with a description of MOOCs, Flipped Classroom and some related works used to support personalized learning in MOOCs. As a result of this investigation, we present some conceptual strategies for educators to design MOOCs from FC ideas and principles. We envisage that adaptation and incorporation of concepts of Flipped Classroom, already applied in face-to-face classroom, can also act as an effective intervention to support personalized learning in MOOCs, helping students to take the active role in their own process acquisition of skills and knowledge construction.", "authors": [{"name": "Marcelo Fassbinder", "affiliation": "Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology, (IFSULDEMINAS - Campus Muzambinho), Muzambinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ellen Francine Barbosa", "affiliation": "Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), S\u00e3o Carlos, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil"}, {"name": "Aracele Garcia de Oliveira Fassbinder", "affiliation": "Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology, (IFSULDEMINAS - Campus Muzambinho), Muzambinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil\u00a0"}], "tags": ["collaborative work", "education", "context", "games", "collaboration", "videos", "online services"]}, {"title": "SmartLAK: A big data architecture for supporting learning analytics services", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344147", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a big data software architecture that uses an ontology, based on the Experience API specification, to semantically represent the data streams generated by the learners when they undertake the learning activities of a course, e.g., in a course.

An alternative that has contributed to the teaching-learning process is the use of Learning Objects (LO), which contribute towards mediating and enhancing the teaching-learning process. One of the great difficulties of learning during the initial semesters of Engineering and Computer Science courses is related to the contents of computer programming, which increases the students' failure level and also the dropout rate of such courses. In order to decrease those rates, we have developed a project to create various learning objects to help teach concepts that are considered difficult to understand by students of Science courses, and the results were very positive.

We provide students with minimal code examples (47 lines of python code in a one-year lab sequence) and no textbook, and require students to search the internet for help to achieve the tasks assigned. This is effective through the use of a pair-programming pedagogy, when students are given tasks at a suitable level. This pedagogical approach should be transferable to any mathematical discipline for which computation is appropriate. Because student effort is focused towards accomplishing tasks within their discipline, they gain the practical skills needed to use computation effectively. Because we give students no templates or example code, they are forced to develop the skill of learning a programming language, and debugging code.

In addition 30% of parents have downloaded mobile mathematics applications for learners to use at home. The most important reason why parents are not downloading mobile mathematics applications is because they do not know where to find them, or they do not have time to search for appropriate applications.

However, this body of research typically focuses on the implementation or theory of security controls and mechanisms at the application, operating system, network, and physical layers. The user layer, long recognized as the weakest link in the security chain, has had little to no attention paid to it by comparison, especially from a sociotechnical perspective which is fairly new to engineering. With the introduction of new technologies putting modern society in an almost constant state of flux, familiarity with technology is no longer simply a luxury, but almost a necessity. To that end, we propose the development of an educational game to help instill vital engineering skills as well as practical and relevant computer security practices to users who might not necessarily have a technical background. This approach would take advantage of the relatively recent explosion in the popularity of video games and digital distribution platforms such as Steam to reach a wider potential audience base.

Discussion with the teacher of the two classes, led to the realization that students are finding a hard time understanding the structure of an atom. Comprehension of the atom is a foundational skill in Chemistry, without the understanding of the atom, many topics in chemistry will be very difficult to understand. To tackle this problem, students in these two classes worked in groups of four, and each group was assigned a periodic element. They used iPads provided by the university to first design the structure of the atom in an app called AutoDesk 123Design. Students then provided their design to a NSF funded GK-12 graduate student fellow, and the 3D models were printed via a 3D printer at Drexel University. Once all atoms were completely printed, the students were able to paint and put together the different components using various household materials. A short PowerPoint presentation was also done by each group to discuss the various elements assigned, their structure and how electrons move in the orbitals of their specific atom. To assess their knowledge a pre and post-test was given to each student, and as a benchmark. Two additional classes that did not participate in this activity were also given a pre and post-test to be used as a control. Results of this study showed that the experimental group had a stronger understanding of the subject matter as opposed to the control group, thus, indicating that technology and arts may had a positive correlation to students' learning experience.", "authors": [{"name": "Adam Fontecchio", "affiliation": "Drexel University, College of Engineering, Philadelphia PA"}, {"name": "Jessica Ward", "affiliation": "Drexel University, College of Engineering, Philadelphia, PA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Daphney Chery", "affiliation": "Drexel University, School of Biomedical Eng.

The PMG-2D simulates a real software development environment where the player, acting as a project manager, goes through all basic phases of a software project lifecycle. There are many roles in the team that have to be managed, and the members have different personalities in order to challenge the player when dealing with people and their conflicts and performance, among other characteristics. The mechanism implemented to control the character's personalities is based on the theory of the Five Big Factors, described by the lexical method conceived in the Psychology area. The evaluation was conducted within the context of a software engineering continuing education course, and 25 participants have played the game and answered a questionnaire.

This project is part of the larger Consortium to Promote Reflection in Engineering Education (CPREE) headed by the University of Washington. In this paper we describe the activities of the Cal Poly group involved with CPREE and how these activities have transformed the thinking and actions of participants. Collaborative inquiry dialogue involves self-organizing individuals into a small group to address a compelling question through repeated cycles of experimentation and reflection on the results of that experimentation. In this context, the faculty members involved (including the authors of this paper) have been meeting to discuss how use of reflection in the classroom and/or in a collaborative inquiry dialogue amongst colleagues might lead to transformation in engineering education practice and outcomes. The dialogue group serves as a safe container that allows for the possibility of transformational insights by participants \u2014 insights that change their view of themselves, the world, and their relationship to it. Using a qualitative self-report methodology in the tradition of an action research paradigm, we (the authors) reflected on what we believed we had gained from the collaborative inquiry dialogues. Broadly we have noticed that participation in the collaborative inquiry dialogue has led us to reconsider what reflection is and what it could be, to develop a greater appreciation for the role of reflective practices in engineering education, and to better recognize when reflection is occurring (and when it might not be) such that reflective behaviors can be encouraged and practiced.

Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of \u201cthe scientific method.\u201d Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground.

Finally, students infrequently directly cited a source of the responsibility, though some described ethical or moral foundations while others talked about an obligation due to possessing certain skills or privileges.

This issue is of particular importance given growing concern that these career patterns reflect fundamental imbalances between the supply of doctoral students seeking academic positions and the availability of such positions. Differences in job expectations and availability can also generate considerable dissatisfaction among students and may negatively impact relationships between students and advisors. In this preliminary study, the authors are investigating career preferences among doctoral students in engineering. The more specific focus of this paper centers on level and changes in preferred career choices during Ph.D. studies, as well as the role faculty advisors play in engineering doctoral students' career decision-making processes. For the purpose of this study, the research participants will be Ph.D. students in a specific level of their graduate study. The method for collecting and analyzing data will be quantitative survey method. The findings from this study have implications for higher education policymakers, faculty advisors, and other stakeholders (e.g., representatives of industry) related to better understanding engineering doctoral students' preferred career choices and changes in those choices during the course of their Ph.D. studies. More specifically, it is expected that the results will help policymakers, administrative staff, and faculty advisors encourage doctoral students to explore multiple career paths so these students can explore and be trained for the full range of likely job opportunities they will face upon graduation.

The survey addressed the faculty member's perceptions of the following: i) personal views concerning STEM education and outreach, ii) peers' attitudes towards STEM education and outreach, and iii) the value the university system places on STEM education and outreach. This survey was coupled with a university-wide effort, which was implemented between the years of 2010 and 2014, to support and encourage faculty who were interested in STEM education and outreach. The results of this investigation support the assertion that new faculty attitudes were better with respect to STEM education and outreach in 2014 when compared to 2012.

Based on this case study, evidence of the applicability of xPBL is demonstrated as is how the behavior should be understood of all stakeholders involved in the process of teaching and learning in one of the most complex disciplines of Software Engineering.", "authors": [{"name": "Simone Santos", "affiliation": "N.E.X.T Research Group, UFPE - Centro de Inform\u00e1tica, Recife, Brazil\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ariane Rodrigues", "affiliation": "N.E.X.T Research Group, UPE - Universidade de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"}, {"name": "Gustavo Alexandre", "affiliation": "N.E.X.T Research Group, UFPE - Centro de Inform\u00e1tica, Recife, Brazil\u00a0"}], "tags": ["software", "planning", "project management", "education", "context", "monitoring", "software engineering"]}, {"title": "Managing first PBL experiences: Cross competences in a traditional environment", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344233", "abstract": "When first introducing PBL into a traditional teaching environment, several problems tend to arise.

Previous studies thoroughly describe PBL course design and practices, but there is a lack of reports about the teaching experience, i.e., how faculty live the process of teaching PBL courses. Thus, we took advantage of this PBL experience to uncover such issues. We developed an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to learn the essences of being a PBL teacher, using a qualitative research methodology. Data collection and analysis entailed semi-structured interviews with five UEFS computer engineering professors, interview transcription and memo writing, open coding, code memo writing, code grouping and abstraction, and description of essences. Results led to the following essences: 1) feedback is essential for student success; 2) PBL develops better students and professionals; 3) assessment is complex and multifaceted; 4) developing good problems is a difficult skill; 5) PBL requires strong teacher engagement and background; 6) it is essential to keep a motivating scenario; and 7) good coordination and group dynamics is required.

We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms.

Occasionally, however, changes occur of such magnitude that they do not just alter current operational practice but require a thorough reappraisal of the underlying assumptions on which that practice is based. In short, they require a review of the dominant way of thinking, or paradigm. Ability to adapt to evolving circumstances is critical, not only for industrial and commercial organisations, but also for individual employees, to survive and remain successful during paradigm shifts. How can we prepare our students so they can survive in a working life characterized by frequent paradigm shifts? It is important that CS and IT education prepares students for coping with shifts induced by technological development in their future careers, that students develop the competencies needed. To understand what competencies are needed, it is important to investigate characteristics among employees that have flourished in earlier paradigm shifts and not least to build knowledge on how to develop learning environments where such competencies and personal characteristics can be achieved This paper is about setting the stage for an action research project aimed at enhancing education with regard to being able to survive paradigm shifts in the IT industry.", "authors": [{"name": "Tony Clear", "affiliation": "Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand\u00a0"}, {"name": "Roger McDermott", "affiliation": "Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK"}, {"name": "Asa Cajander", "affiliation": "Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Anna Eckerdal", "affiliation": "Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Mats Daniels", "affiliation": "Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Mats Lind", "affiliation": "Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}, {"name": "Aletta Nylen", "affiliation": "Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\u00a0"}], "tags": ["industries", "education", "context", "telecommunications", "employment", "programming", "companies"]}, {"title": "Addressing the problem of mal-employment of liberal arts graduates", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344256", "abstract": "Unlike technical graduates such as engineering and science, liberal arts graduates usually encounter difficulty finding jobs in their majors.

Thus in our program, we have adhered to the idea that knowledge in microcontroller fundamentals is necessary for all types of engineering majors. However, the difficulty arises when a traditional classroom teaching with examples and non-creative projects instill boredom amongst students. Students fail to make the connection of how important this understanding will be in their future studies, be it mechanical, electrical or other majors. We feel there is a missed opportunity to engage engineering students early in their program with a highly relevant and easily tangible experience working with intellectual microcontroller-based projects. In order to improve the experience, we introduce our students to the basics using laboratory exercises on the Arduino platform and then transition to a full-featured in-house autonomous robot platform for the final project. The paper first talks about our current approach in teaching microcontroller topics to the students followed by the need to develop the autonomous robot platform. The robot platform was developed in-house by the undergraduate students using the available in-house resources. The autonomous robot utilizes a commercial chassis, wheels and tracks along with geared DC motors that include embedded quadrature position encoders. In addition to the chassis, the undergraduate students have also used off-the-shelf hardware for robot control and Arduino interface for student developed code. The paper then talks about the various kinds of laboratory exercises and projects that can be implemented on this platform by the students in their introductory digital systems course that they take as sophomores.

Indeed, group learning performance is largely dependent on group composition.

Specifically we investigate the impact that a combination of individual student performances and gender have on the group performance and intend to find generic segmentation guidelines that would map smoothly onto the groupwork performance. A novel grouping method is proposed, which splits the set of students into groups that maximize one of the two desired criteria: the expected average groupwork performance or the average improvement achieved by a student as a result of synergic group learning and interaction effects.

Modern learning theory has found that learning performance can be improved effectively through cooperative/ collaborative learning. How to group students in one class based on their different learning capabilities is a key to success in education. Two grouping types of homogeneous and heterogeneous have been applied into class grouping. Research proves that homogeneous groups are good at specific goal and heterogeneous groups are better in expanded tasks. Learning efficiency is affected in both group level and individual level by different grouping method. However grouping students in an optimal way is a difficult NP-hard research problem with high complexity; and to achieve the best results, such grouping can be very time consuming and tedious for the teachers to perform manually, especially when local cultural context (for instance, gender parameter) has to be taken into account, such as in the Middle East region. So the ability of allowing educators to define rules describing groups is very important for both homogeneous and heterogeneous grouping capabilities.

This enables the use of partial known model structure and labels as expert knowledge to guide the model learning procedure from the text without labels. Compared with the existing partial/semi-supervised HDP, the proposed method is able to make use of the known labels for not only structure construction, but also parameter learning. This enhancement provides a more flexible way and better guide for the model learning from the unlabelled documents. We experimentally investigate the contribution of partial knowledge to guide the model learning process. The proposed partial-supervision for HDP is applied to student micro-blog automatic classification and adds intelligence to our student social media platform (ELSE).", "authors": [{"name": "Jason Ng", "affiliation": "Etisalat BT Innovation Center, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE"}, {"name": "Ahmed Al Dhanhani", "affiliation": "Etisalat BT Innovation Center, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE\u00a0"}, {"name": "Di Wang", "affiliation": "Etisalat BT Innovation Center, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE\u00a0"}, {"name": "Ahmad Al-Rubaie", "affiliation": "Etisalat BT Innovation Center, Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE\u00a0"}], "tags": ["social network services", "supervised learning", "technological innovation", "education", "mathematical model", "media", "collaboration"]}, {"title": "A B-learning new approach applied to a practical power electronics converters course", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344270", "abstract": "An Industrial Electronic discipline, involving different topics and technologies was designed to improve the sequence of activities within the available time and learning resources.

The Loop Transfer Recovery technique was used to recover some of the robustness properties that can be lost when implementing the Kalman filter. The Kalman Filter resulted in a better state estimator with less estimation noise on the velocities state variables, compared to the velocities state variables that were estimated with the asymptotic observer. Furthermore, Loop-Transfer Recovery allowed for a better tuning of the Kalman filter based controller and resulted in a better time response of the system.

To verify the built circuit's operation on the solderless breadboard, with a digital integrated circuit, it is necessary to generate input signals and display the output signals, as well as a probe in order to check the logic level at any point in the circuit. For this, there are two options: using didactic modules for experiments with digital circuits, or generating input signals with switches and showing the output signals with LEDs.

The 2014 College Board National Report states when compared to similar peers, students who receive a score of 3 or higher in an AP exam tend to earn higher college grade point averages (GPAs), have higher graduation rates, and have the opportunity to take more discipline course work in college. This report is based on all the AP courses offered by College Board. It is not certain what the outcomes are for an individual course, i.e. AP Calculus, or how the markers of success translate to engineering students and engineering programs. By analyzing 3,600 engineering students academic records from Fall 2012 and 2014 (i.e. gender, ethnicity, residency, grade received in Calculus I course, AP Calculus exam score, High School GPA, SAT/ACT Math and Verbal score), this study seeks to describe patterns of success in students' subsequent Calculus courses from those who accepted AP Calculus credit, skipping Calculus I, as opposed to those who did not accept their AP Calculus credit and took Calculus I. Students ask for recommendations from their first year engineering advisors on whether to retake Calculus I in college or accept their AP Calculus credit, which consists of a score of 4 or 5 at this university. As research in this specific topic is absent, advisors in a first year engineering program must advise in the absence of concrete data.

However, most of the problems students are asked to solve during their degree programs are classroom problems. Most studies of ambiguity in problem solving have defined ambiguity as a characteristic of the problems. We are interested in understanding how students interpret engineering problems, either creating or resolving ambiguity during their problem solving process. The research question that guides this study is: How is ambiguity manifested by engineering students as they solve problems? This study is part of a larger project examining engineering students' engineering problem solving across different types of engineering problems. Twenty materials engineering students were asked to solve four materials engineering problems during a think-aloud session. For the analysis, points of ambiguity during the problem-solving process were identified as periods in which the students specifically verbalized uncertainty. The points of ambiguity in the transcript were then analyzed through script analysis. More specifically textual instances of ambiguity were linked with three main periods and situational categories: a) the situation that caused the ambiguity, 2) what happened during the point of ambiguity, and 3) the reaction of the student after reaching the point of ambiguity. Results indicated that students experienced points of ambiguity in both closed- and open-ended problems. Several motifs were common to both types of problems, including confusion over how to use given values, not having necessary content knowledge, lack of self-confidence, and difficulty conceptualizing the problem. The lack of constraints inherent in the open-ended problems also caused additional ambiguity among some students. Our findings show that ambiguity can take many forms and is not just a function of the problem structure. Students reach points of ambiguity (e.g., points where they do not know what to do next), due to many factors. Some of these factors represent aspects of their academic and epistemological development. Our analysis to date suggests that students need more comprehensive training and practice to be prepared in facing problems that reflect the work in engineering practice. We are currently examining the data further to identify patterns in their response to ambiguity, which may help in developing pedagogical strategies and tools to support students' ability to successfully solve engineering problems.", "authors": [{"name": "Mirka Koro-Ljungberg", "affiliation": "Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Arizona State University Tempe, AZ, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Elliot P.

Particularly, we have addressed problem solving situations that essentially consist of mapping a logic expression into another equivalent, for example, the task of simplifying digital circuits. To do that, we have considered to operate on two symbolic linked representations: Boolean Algebra and Logic, connecting these two representations to a visual one with logic gates. This integration comes from the importance to involve students in three equivalent representations, permitting them to make connections between them. The learning environment contains a knowledge-based assistant that works on a collection of scenarios with several associated problems, where the students are placed in a problem-solving situation. To each problem, there are pedagogical resources needed to provide the students with feedback and knowledge support based on their performance and identified needs. Furthermore, there is an adaptive mechanism that is responsible for how problems should be sequenced or ordered, and even we have designed a switcher mechanism, which permits the students to change from one to another representation.

Since 2003, this course has been cross-listed as a mechanical engineering elective and a fine arts studio course, and brings together mixed teams of engineering and fine arts photography or film students. With its focus on the production of aesthetically pleasing and scientifically useful images of fluid flows, it is one of the few course offerings that explicitly calls upon engineering students to use an aesthetic sense in their studies. In prior work, this course was associated with a positive shift in affect toward fluid flows, which we measured through the Fluids Perception Survey (FluPerS) [1]. In the same survey, students expressed a greater awareness of fluids. This outcome was in contrast to the survey results from Fluid Mechanics, a traditional engineering core course, with a highly analytic, mathematical approach. Exit surveys of students in Fluid Mechanics reveal a negative shift in affect, which is typical of other technical courses, with no comments about awareness of fluids. The increased awareness of fluids can be termed an expansion of perception \u2014 when learners see everyday objects, events, or issues through the lens of the content [2]. Expansion of perception is often associated with deeper conceptual understanding and the ability to transfer learning to new settings. Building on the prior survey work, we conducted interviews with students from Flow Vis, both engineering students (n=4) and art/film students (n=5), in addition to Fluid Mechanics students (n=3), at the beginning and end of a semester. Their comments, along with open responses in the survey (n=86), are being analyzed using an iterative process to develop an emergent coding scheme. We want to discover what about Flow Vis helps students, both from engineering and art, internalize and apply their understanding of fluids. What role does the emphasis on aesthetics, so familiar to the art students, so uncommon in coursework for the engineers, play? Finally, how can we adapt the teaching practices from Flow Vis for other courses, other content areas?

The course focuses on shedding light on sustainability related issues such as environmental pollution, resource utilization, and economics of sustainability. It resorts to innovative design practices as well as novel product ideas as a tool to enhance sustainability. To this end, the course emphasizes hands on learning through design, development and analysis of products from the point of view of sustainability. Students from all majors across the university typically take this class. They are encouraged to think about a problem critically and approach it from the design perspective in order to try and solve the underlying environmental problem. A physical product prototype is required as part of the final project. In view of the fact that sustainability is comprised of three main pillars namely: environmental, social and economic, students are also required to examine the profitability of their project on a rudimentary level. Students are free to work either individually or as part of a group. Class presentations are due at the end of each semester and are comprised of a design prototype, economic analysis and the environmental relevance of their design solutions.

Some teachers observe, and students report, that students commonly skim such text. As such, a writing style that aggressively minimizes text while still teaching the core technical topic may improve student learning; if text is short enough, students may then read and study the text more carefully. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of text quantity on amount learned. We created and compared content styles using a lesson that taught Google search techniques. The two main content styles were normal text and minimal text. The normal text style included 6\u201312 sentences followed by 1\u20133 examples. The minimal text style included 1\u20132 sentences followed by 1\u20133 examples. We conducted a randomized control study with 168 participants enrolled in a college-level Introduction to Computing course for non-computing majors. Each participant was randomly assigned one lesson style. We provided a pre-lesson and post-lesson quiz, each with ten questions. Additionally, the participants completed background and follow-up surveys. The study was part of a course homework assignment, so self-selection bias was limited. The course is primarily taken by non-majors and covers the basics of Word, Excel, and HTML. An improvement score is a participant's post-lesson minus pre-lesson quiz scores. The average improvement score for minimal text was 2.4 (6.5 \u2212 4.1), which is higher (p-value < 0.01) than the average improvement score for normal text of 1.1 (5.1 \u2212 4.0). Thus, teaching the same topic using less text led to more learning. The conclusion is not that materials should be watered down, but rather that great attention should be paid to using minimal text while teaching the same core topics.", "authors": [{"name": "Frank Vahid", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Alex Edgcomb", "affiliation": "Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Roman Lysecky", "affiliation": "Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"}], "tags": ["particle measurements", "google", "usability", "education", "atmospheric measurements", "length measurement", "writing"]}, {"title": "Virtual laboratory platform for computer science curricula", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344323", "abstract": "Experimenting in computer science course is challenging due to the limitation of site, equipment and special experiment tools.

In the first virtual lab, every experiment instrument in real lab is visualized as a Java component. In the other kind of virtual lab, the algorithm students learn in the course is packed as a Web Service component by C, C++ or Java. In both platforms, those components are listed in the system. Students is able to select Java components or Web Service components as the experiment they want to do need and integrate them by building connections between them. Then, the students can set input for the experiment in the input component. After click the button of rum, the result will be display for the students in the platform. In the two kinds of virtual lab, students can also write the code in the platform. After it is submitted, those codes will be transferred as a component by the platform and be added in the component list. Then they can use them as the components provide by the platform. So, they can test if the algorithm they write is correct. Both platforms are developed by Java Applet and can be run by a browse. By using our system, students can experiment at any time and any place via the Internet. Teacher is also able to do experiment in the classroom.

To do so, we are developing a remote laboratory that will be used in the sessions of science and technology in a school. Concept of electromagnetic crane has been chosen because a crane is a common tool. It is an object used in construction and in factories. Using electromagnet power to move metal objects is also a common concept that children can understand. Using these tools as an example, we seek to bring science to everyday life and promote the interests of children and young people in engineering and technology. The aim is to encourage them to seek education in engineering programs in the future, and teach them to understand and appreciate how important technology is. Initially, the laboratory will move left and right in a circumference of 350 degrees and permit up and down different preselected masses. Also, students can increase or decrease the voltage of the electromagnet to raise masses. The entire system will be accessible remotely by the student who will be able to move the crane, activate or deactivate the electromagnet, and lift or take down the masses. At the same time, the user interface displays the image of the laboratory and a graph showing the relationship between the power and its capacity to lift the mass every time the student applies voltage to the solenoid. All of this will allow us to see the effect that the applied voltage has over lifting the mass.

The students will interact with the remote laboratory from their homes, but also, the laboratory can be used in the classroom taking advantage of the data displayed through the user interface.

Some of this understanding can be gleaned from traditional academic course evaluations, but student perceptions yield an additional level of understanding. For this study we analyzed data from multiple offerings of a 7-week graduate level numerical analysis course; Application of Finite Element Analysis. Over three years this course was offered residentially and online using multiple delivery modes. We categorize the delivery modes as Traditional, Class-Capture, and Modularized/Blended. Each student studied the material using one delivery mode and was then asked to review the material using another delivery mode.

One additional benefit is greater flexibility in designing the learning context within which the laboratory can be positioned.

We find synergy in combining the two pedagogical approaches in most of the labs in our communications systems course, and this typically results in enhanced student comprehension.

This study comparatively examines the intercultural experiences of a) engineering Ph.D. students from the U.S. who traveled abroad, and b) international engineering Ph.D. students who traveled to the U.S. Findings indicate that students tended to prepare themselves for travel abroad in various ways, and that negative experiences of domestic students abroad are related to a mismatch between pre-travel expectations and actual experiences. International students more frequently mention cross-cultural differences, and those with greater levels of support tended to report easier adjustments. Findings can be applied toward helping U.S. and international academic institutions identify strategies to develop graduate students' global competency levels.", "authors": [{"name": "Matilde Sanchez-Pena", "affiliation": "Department of Engineering Education, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Joyce B.

Studies show that students who study abroad are better prepared for success in their respective fields of interest. This is no less true for engineering students. But engineering schools have been very slow accepting the challenge of providing study abroad opportunities to students, due perhaps to the rigidity of most engineering curricula which were developed in the last century. This trend is changing, however. The largest increase in students studying abroad are STEM students \u2014 in 2012/13 9% overall were from STEM disciplines and 2/3rd of these were engineering students. Many universities offer short-term study abroad programs for engineering students designed to be held during the summer. These short-term programs strive to accommodate those who cannot afford to delay their coursework. It can be suggested that semester-long programs provide greater cross-cultural benefits but providing a study abroad curriculum that fits the stringent engineering requirements can be difficult. The College of Engineering at The University of Oklahoma has developed an engineering study abroad program that offers key engineering courses chosen to fit a wide variety of discipline-specific engineering curricula. The key to success in any program is faculty involvement. In order to promote faculty involvement the course work is broken into concentrated four-week blocks taught by different engineering instructors, providing an opportunity for professors with active research programs to share their current expertise with the students in a foreign setting. In order to provide a cohesive educational experience, a Unified Project is developed that has components that relate to each course and which takes advantage of opportunities offered by the host country. This study model is expected to provide smooth transitions from one concentrated course to the next, while providing the students with the cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural experience that engineers will need to compete on a global marketplace.", "authors": [{"name": "P.

In the US context this problematic transition has been observed in students transferring from community colleges into the traditional university system. In Ireland's binary higher education structure, one set of institutions, known as Institutes of Technology (IoTs) allow for this transition to take place entirely within individual institutions. This paper is part of an ongoing investigation into one such IoT, where engineering students who achieve high grades at the end of 3-year (so-called Level 7) \u201cordinary degree\u201d programs frequently transfer into the 3rd year of 4-year Level 8 \u201chonors degree\u201d programs, with surprisingly successful outcomes. One surprise derives from the fact that the students who enter Level 7 engineering programs are deemed at the outset to be academically less able, particularly in mathematics, than those who go directly into Level 8 programs from secondary school. Relatively little work has been done on this transition to date. In the 3rd and 4th year of many honors engineering programs within this institution it is not unusual to have 30\u201350% of the students coming from an ordinary degree background, the majority from within the institution itself \u2014 with others transferring from other IoTs in Ireland. Previous research has shown that students from this background initially struggle in the 3rd year of the honors degree program when compared with students who have proceeded directly through the honors program, before going on to successfully graduate. Can this be attributed to \u2018transfer shock\u2019 even though most of these students are continuing in an institution and with faculty that they are already familiar with? In order to examine this phenomenon we interview students from several engineering disciplines at various points in this transition.

It forms part of the Information Technology course at the North-West University's Vaal Triangle Campus.

It is designed to allow students not having access to Internet away from campus, access to peers while preparing for formative and summative assessment. Felder and Silverman developed five dimensions of learning preferences, each with two sections. Their research built on the research of Kolb, Meyers-Briggs and Jung. The dimensions include: perception where learning takes place in an intuitive way or by sensing; input which may be visual or verbal; organizing which may be inductive or deductive; processing where students learn through active participation or on their own through reflection; and understanding in a sequential or global way. The WhatsApp environment was included in students learning repertoire to allow for differences in learning preferences and to enable students to get answers to questions while away from campus. With WhatsApp being a social media platform, we may assume that students who learn actively will be more inclined to use it. Since text is used to communicate, we may suspect that verbal learners will also benefit. Pictures can be sent, which may assist visual learners. In this way, it may be argued that most learning preferences can be addressed in a conversation group. Are these assumptions true? Does instant messaging address most learning preferences? This paper will attempt to identify students from the different learning preferences by analyzing the WhatsApp conversations among them.

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.", "authors": [{"name": "Jun Zheng", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China\u00a0"}, {"name": "Fengxia Li", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China\u00a0"}, {"name": "Sanyuan Zhao", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China"}, {"name": "Dongni Li", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China\u00a0"}], "tags": ["animation", "computers", "education", "turing machines", "random access memory", "computer science", "computational modeling"]}, {"title": "A new signal processing course for digital culture", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2015.7344377", "abstract": "Signal processing algorithms, software, and hardware are being used in several fields including non-engineering areas such as arts and media.

K-means algorithm has been used to determine the similarity of the students. This is an extremely efficient and simple algorithm for clustering analysis and widely used in data mining. Given a value of K, the algorithm partitions a data set into K clusters. Seven experiments on the whole data set and ten experiments on the training data set and testing data set were conducted.

Among other factors, one of the causes of this deficit is the high failure rate in the disciplines within the technical area which causes students to take up to twice the time required to complete the course. This phenomenon is also reflected in the Vocational courses of the Engineering area mainly because the students are teenagers that quickly discourage before traditional classes. Therefore there is a failure to achieve the goal of education and considering the specificities of each student deficiencies. One of the issues that has been extensively studied in recent years is how we can improve the teaching of technical subjects in vocational courses and engineering that, in Brazil, have a failure rate that reaches 40% in some cases. In countries with more developed education, such as Finland, Sweden, Korea and others, they are already using more modern methods aimed at excellence in learning, such as \"Project Based Learning, \"Collaborative Learning\", \"Learning by Doing\", \"No Child Left Behind\", among others. These methods change the educational philosophy and teaching bases, putting the student as a central element of learning and working their specificities and self-development in a participatory and motivating environment. Thus, this paper presents the use of these modern methodologies applied to technical vocational education in the Federal Institute of Amazonas, in Mechanical Areas, Electronic and Electrical Engineering, in subjects in which failure rate reached 40% when using the traditional teaching used by the Campus. The results of using these methodologies in four groups involving about 120 students demonstrated substantial improvement in the learning of technical subjects, with consequent reduction in the failure rate and increase the motivation and self-esteem of students to give continuity to the studies in this area and join Engineering courses.", "authors": [{"name": "Hayanne S.

Each peer-generated video annotation text file was coded to characterize the type of feedback given, encompassing characterizations such as: good practice, suggestions; types of teacher knowledge; and general attributes of teaching. The demographics of the peer authors, for corresponding annotations, are also classified based on highest degree, familiarity with the course as an instructor, and familiarity as a student. Findings indicate that a majority of the comments are related to the direct instruction of the course, rather than the content of the instruction. While not statistically significant, familiarity with the course as instructor is positively correlated to the number of comments pertaining to pedagogical content knowledge.

Clear communicated project goal, where the students have specific roles, with assigned accountable peers, everything under the umbrella of an Agile-like software development process (derived from SCRUM) are in the core of the activity. This paper details the incremental implementation methodology of the program among four research areas, and 23 projects or project activities, involving 34 students. The results of the two years running program will also be described, including the increase of progress visibility by advisors, the improvement of students communication and writing skills and the qualification on SCRUM software development process tools and documentation. The authors mapped important success factors in achieving relevant improvement on students' profile, and presented a list of recommendations for the next phase of the program, including some obvious one, as the importance of the active participation of advisors, and some less obvious one, like the resistance to the Internet online tool due to daily meeting coinciding with the peak of Internet usage in the University.", "authors": [{"name": "Jose Reginaldo Hughes Carvalho", "affiliation": "Post-graduate Program in Informatics (PPGI), Institute of Computing (ICOMP), Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), Av.

Through good management it is possible to achieve deadlines, budgets goals and mainly delivering a product that meets customer expectations. Project management activity encompasses: measurement and metrics; estimation; risk analysis; schedules; tracking and control. Considering the importance of managing projects, it is necessary that courses related to Information Technology and Computer Science present to students concepts, techniques and methodology necessary to cover all project management activities. Software project management courses aim at preparing students to apply management techniques required to plan, organize, monitor and control software projects. In a nutshell, software project management focuses on process, problem and people. In this paper we proposed an approach to teaching and learning of software project management using practical activities. The intention of this work is to provide the experience of applying theoretical concepts in practical activities. The teaching and learning approach, applied since 2006 in a Computer Science course, is based on teamwork. Each team is divided into groups assuming different roles of software process development. We have set four groups, each one assuming a different role (manager; software quality assurance; analyst and designer; programmer). The team must be conducted across the software process by its manager. We use four projects, each group is in charge of managing a different project.

The Mctbbl model analyzes and researches the application of computational thinking in computer science by the organic combination of computational thinking and blended learning in a life-cycle perspective. On one hand, the model can summarize the core concepts and important principles in computer science and extract the typical thoughts and general methods of solving problems; on the other hand, the model can implement the teaching and learning of computational thinking by means of blended learning. Based on the model, the teachers can teach the problem-solving process by using computer more intuitively and clearly and the students can understand the application of computer knowledge more easily and simply.

Students could learn by developing new components to be added to the current simulator. Second, any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected. The proposed simulator has been developed to teach digital circuits. However, it can be used in many other computing engineering fields. Third point is motivation, where the lessons are driven by the following principle: To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you. Nowadays, we are surrounded by Internet of things, where the simulator engine could be connected to learn and to motivate the students.

The process to prepare basic information to design a course in STEM follows the following steps: 1. Students must present one paper to classmates in a seminar (student prepopulates and sent to the teacher specially prepared for this purpose form). 2. Based on several papers, students must present different solutions for one problem in the area defined by the teacher, e.g. urban studies. We applied our approach experimentally to develop initial learning materials with the first intake of students to a new master program in Urban Supercomputing. During \"Urban Systems Analysis\" course, students prepared the materials for the next course \"Urban Computer's Simulation\".
