There are several basic aspects of human cognition that are critical to instructional design. First, based on evolutionary educational psychology, cognitive load theory assumes that most topics taught in educational and training institutions are ones that we have not specifically evolved to learn. Such topics require biologically secondary knowledge rather than the biologically primary knowledge that we have evolved to acquire. Second, these instructionally relevant topics require learners to acquire domain-specific rather than generic cognitive skills. Third, while generic cognitive knowledge does not require explicit instruction because we have evolved to acquire it, domain-specific concepts and skills that provide the content of educational syllabi, do require explicit instruction. These three factors interact with the well-known capacity and duration constraints of working memory and the unlimited capacity and duration characteristics of long-term memory to delineate a cognitive architecture relevant to instructional design. The working memory limits do not apply to biologically primary, generic knowledge acquired without explicit instruction but do apply to the biologically secondary, domain-specific knowledge that requires explicit instruction and that is relevant to computer science education. Human cognition when dealing with such knowledge constitutes a natural information processing system that has evolved to mimic the architecture of biological evolution. Cognitive load theory uses this architecture to generate a large range of instructional effects concerned with procedures for reducing extraneous working memory load in order to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge in long-term memory. This talk reviews the theory and indicates the instructional implications relevant to computer education.", "authors": [{"name": "John Sweller", "affiliation": "University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"}], "tags": ["instructional design", "cognitive load theory", "human cognition"]}, {"title": "Service as Rent", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2839509.2844550", "abstract": "\"Service is the rent we pay for the space we take up on earth\", my dad's mantra, and one used by many.

It is a startling change over just the last 5 years. Over that 5 years, much has been accomplished at the high school level. The Exploring Computer Science and Advanced Placement\u00ae CS Principles courses were created to engage and inspire a diverse mix of students. Hundreds of teachers and university faculty have collaborated to develop course materials, assessments, MOOCS, and models of teacher professional development. Over 2,000 high schools now offer new CS courses, but that leaves out more than 34,000.\nEven then, students will need more than a single course, they will need a K-16 CS pathway. At the K-8 level, CS does not have the decades of research on the teaching and learning that is available to many other, more established disciplines. A stronger evidence base is needed as the basis for pedagogy, curricula, standards, and teacher preparation. The CS community must put greater emphasis on research in CS education and broadening participation, and it must build stronger collaborations with researchers in related disciplines.\nOver the last 5 years, college-level CS departments have been inundated with students. This growth is fueled by a strong job market for CS majors and an increasing awareness that computation is fundamental to many other industry sectors and academic disciplines. How will departments cope with increasing numbers without sacrificing access or quality? How will they respond to increasing diversity of ethnicity and gender, but also of interests, and career goals of their students?

This enables OSBLE+ to provide students and instructors with a visual analytics environment in which they can explore, compare, and contrast the programming activities of students in the class. Second, the plugin turns Visual Studio into a social programming environment by injecting into it a social media-style activity stream, which enables students (a) to pose and answer programming questions, and (b) to see and explore the programming activities of their peers. Students' social activities within the activity stream are sent to OSBLE+, and are subsequently included as data in the visual analytics environment.

Instructors can provide students with self-contained notebooks that include instructions, coding exercises, and written responses all in the same place. Students can write and execute code in these notebooks, and any text or images produced by the code are displayed immediately beneath the input that produced them.

Enrollments had \"fallen to such an extent that some academic computing programs were facing significant reductions in staffing levels or even elimination\". The community responded, with panels to investigate and highlight ways to infuse \"passion, beauty, joy and awe\" into the introductory experiences, the CS10K project to bring computing to 10,000 teachers and 100,000 students, and better messaging of career opportunities, to name a few of the initiatives to bring students back into our seats.\nWell, by golly, it worked! It certainly didn't hurt our cause that Wall Street almost collapsed, young whiz kids were becoming TECH billionaires, an inspiring video and an interactive website led millions of people to code for an hour every December, or smart devices put computing into the hands of young people, and social media became the killer app. Whatever it was, CS became hot again. And we mean HOT. There are now several institutions around the world that have well over a thousand students taking CS1 in the Fall of 2015. There's just so much lemonade one can make before the seams start to burst, and the wheels come off the bus, as many shared at SIGCSE 2015 at the Birds of the Feather session.\nThe goal of this panel is to bring together educators who were charged with delivering face-to-face CS1 on the grandest scale the field has ever seen. How did they cope? Does it become all people management with an army of Teaching Assistants? What were the differences and common themes in their survival plans? What is working? What mistakes were made? How are they supporting differential learning for the students who don't have the same experience as others? How is diversity being affected?

In prior research, we incorporated programming data into a statistical model that accounted for a significant amount of a student's course performance. In a separate line of research, we explored how online social networking tools might be leveraged for pedagogical purposes. Rather than treating our explorations of students' programming and social behaviors as separate research spaces, we are next considering the interplay between social behavior, programming behavior, and course performance. As a first step, we incorporated online social participation into our statistical model of programming behaviors. The outcome was quite promising: we witnessed a 30% increase in our model's effect size. This result would seem to indicate that neither programming behavior nor social behavior alone can fully account for student performance.\nEncouraged by this result, we are now considering how social interaction influences programming decisions and vice versa. In particular:\nAfter receiving help on a social network, what changes are made to code? Are these changes more or less likely to move the student closer to a correct solution?\nHow do students address coding problems when their questions are left unanswered?\nAt what points in the programming process are students more likely to pose questions?

The CoordinationTracker project uses social network analysis both to study coordination in student project teams, and to develop an automated tool to support students learning this skill. In this talk, I will briefly present some results using social network analysis and socio-technical congruence measures to study communication in a software engineering course, and then will describe the design of the proposed CoordinationTracker tool, which will use socio-technical congruence measures to give feedback to students. For example, as a student works on a file, an automated reminder capability will suggest who the student should be communicating with in order to prevent unwanted effects on components dependent on the file. The system also will have a reporting component which will allow each student, as well as the instructor, to view his or her coordination performance via graphs.

We have also embedding many of our programming examples in applications from fields like biology and psychology.

In lecture, we discuss problem-solving with high-level programming constructs like conditionals and loops, using only pseudocode. In our new lab section, students are taught how to translate those ideas into C++ code. This allows us to free the initial learning of problem-solving from the complications of a language like C++.

Because of these dependencies, students with a disability (e.g., mobility limitations or vision impairment) generally are unable to use block languages, thereby reducing the opportunities for broader participation in computational learning activities. Given the increasing need to broaden the participation of computing to those with diverse skills and backgrounds, it is important that the tools used to initiate the earliest entre into computing do not erect immediate roadblocks that impede initial interest and opportunity. There are many variations of user interfaces and assistive technologies that benefit those who may have difficulties utilizing traditional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), but these tools often cannot be used universally across block languages. As more block languages are being developed and integrated into K12 and University curriculum, it is imperative that accessible solutions are discussed and implemented. These discussions require participation from the block language developer community, accessible computing community, and those educators who encounter accessibility needs among the students in their classrooms.

Results indicate discrepancies in access to technology and computer science. Over 75% of principals reported their school did not offer computer science with programming/coding, but Hispanic students reported lower exposure to computers at home and in school and Black students and lower income students reported less access to computer science learning in school. Hispanic students and female students were also less likely to have learned computer science or have confidence to learn computer science compared to their counterparts. Finally, we explored barriers to access and identified a harsh disconnect: parent and student demand for computer science education was high while administrators' perceptions of this demand was low. Additionally, the most common barriers to offering computer science cited by principals and superintendents were the need to dedicate time to other courses and testing requirements and the lack of qualified teachers, with technology less common of a barrier.", "authors": [{"name": "Jennifer Wang", "affiliation": "Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Jason Ravitz", "affiliation": "Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Hai Hong", "affiliation": "Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"}, {"name": "Sepehr Hejazi Moghadam", "affiliation": "Google, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"}], "tags": ["superintendents", "diversity", "pre-college", "knowledge", "black", "income.", "hispanic", "parents", "african american", "k-12", "high school", "access", "barriers", "latino/a", "pre-university", "principals", "teachers", "middle school", "perceptions", "underrepresented minorities"]}, {"title": "Session details: Paper Session: Tools", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3260413", "abstract": "No abstract available.", "authors": [{"name": "Bina Ramamurthy", "affiliation": "SUNY Buffalo"}], "tags": []}, {"title": "Supporting Active Learning by Introducing an Interactive Teaching Tool in a Data Structures and Algorithms Course", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2839509.2844653", "abstract": "Traditionally, theoretical foundations in data structures and algorithms (DSA) courses have been covered through lectures followed by tutorials, where students practise their understanding on pen-and-paper tasks.

Although the user interface is mainly in English, the characteristics of these easy-to-use, game-based, and interactive tools attract many teachers and researchers in the world to pay much attention to the possibilities and opportunities of introducing these tools to students. Recently, some primary school teachers in Hong Kong begin to independently introduce some of these programming tools to students at age 7 - 11 as a part of learning activities in their computer lessons. Their motives are similar but not the same, such as making a fun learning and teaching experience, motivating students for active and collaborative participation, and introducing CT concepts to develop generic skills (e.g. problem solving skills, creativity, and critical thinking). However, there is an absence of well-developed and planned curriculum for \"coding education\" to introduce computational thinking systematically to students in the local context with expected learning outcomes. Due to the uniqueness of K-12 curriculum in Hong Kong, the existing curriculum model in the U.S. may need to be customized and redesigned to become suitable for integrating into the curriculum in Hong Kong.

The clicker questions were used to engage students by strategically asking questions that differentiated between correct ideas and common misconceptions.

Providing social support is important because it has been shown to improve both student retention (Slavin 1990, Tinto 1987, Wenger 1999) and performance (Hsiung 2012, Kulkarni 2015, MacNeil 2015). Most forms of active learning use a flipped classroom model of teaching where students are expected to interact with materials, such as lecture videos, alone before class and then engage in active learning during class time (Lage 2000). In our previous work with team-based learning, students generally preferred learning in face-to-face teams (MacNeil 2016). To support co-located teams outside of class, we propose the design for a mobile app that is currently in development which uses students' location to form ad-hoc social learning opportunities for students that are located near each other. We take inspiration from flash teams, which create dynamic expert teams based on the availability of experts online (Retelny 2014). Our app will create teams based on the availability of students and their range of expertise, while leveraging additional context, such as student's location and intention. Students upload course topics that they are struggling with and a general geo-location.

Therefore, we decided to divide the class profiling the students into two roles: a) Mechanics, which showed proficiency on mathematics and critical thinking among the class and b) Pilots, who showed some gaps on their skills. Both profiles will develop critical thinking, problem solving and algorithmic thinking by the end of the semester. Gamification as an educational trend refers not just to the use of games mechanics, but also to the development of game environments in order to improve motivation, concentration, effort, and loyalty among other positive values common to all gamers. Gamification is seen as a powerful strategy to influence and motivate people. The objectives of applying this kind of trend on a class are: The transformation of class activities into challenges, foster leadership of the participants, develop collaborative teams, reward efficiency and effort in the development of activities and foster meaningful learning experience.

Inspired in part by Jeannette Wing's (Wing 2008) notion of the essence and pervasiveness of computational thinking, a growing community within SIGCSE is exploring tools that encourage computational thinking that don't use traditional computer science terminology or computer programming (Basawapna 2013, Daily 2014, Freeman 2014, Miller 2014, Wolz 2011). However, that community has not yet explored how to teach computational thinking through bio-design. Synthetic biology is a relatively new research field where scientists engineer living organisms to exhibit new behaviors. Biologists arrange and combine BioBricks, sequences of DNA that exhibit a behavior, sense an environmental factor, or indicate the beginning or end of a larger sequence. Bio-design not only incorporates traditional principles of computational thinking (abstraction, modularity, design/build/test), but also introduces new challenges that force the user to apply these principles in new ways. Interacting with biology can thus 1) help deepen understanding for people who are proficient in computational thinking, 2) provide a platform for introduction to computational thinking for the first time. Because most bio-design is performed in a wetlab by experienced biologists, we focus now on designing and developing low-barrier digital tools for interacting with biology.

The large transition gap between blocks-based and text-based programming is a source of worry for many educators. However, the difficulties learners have with developing and maintaining progressively larger and more complex programs in block-based systems force teachers to move students on to text-based systems rather than remain with blocks. Greenfoot 3 introduces frame-based programming, a hybrid of blocks-based and text-based programming. Frame-based programming adds comprehensive keyboard support, along with several other usability improvements aimed at removing frustrations for intermediate and experienced programmers, while also providing a way to fill the gap in the transition process.\nThis workshop will show how to teach introductory programming using the new frame-based editor from Greenfoot 3. We will help the participants to explore the new editor in a hands-on session, accompanied by explanations of its distinctive features and how they have been designed to overcome the friction and niggles present in current blocks-based editors, while also providing pedagogical guidance for learners.

But these benefits of a well-written rubric extend also to those of us without a grading staff, even to single classrooms of twenty or so students. Good rubrics will change your life!\nIn this workshop, we will present various principles we have found to write effective analytic rubrics for student programming work, helping to keep our grading unbiased and to assess the student work more quickly. We will show specific examples of good rubrics, and then participants will jointly grade some sample work according to a shared rubric, discussing what works and what doesn't. Finally, participants will break into small groups to workshop a rubric for an assignment they've given in their own class. Most examples will be at the CS1/CS2 level (and CS1-only educators are welcome), but some of the discussion will address higher-level courses as well.\nParticipants should bring the specification/handout for a programming assignment they have recently given in class (which need not be CS1/CS2), and are encouraged (if possible) to bring a small number of handed-in student solutions for that assignment.
