An analysis of the results was carried out to assess understanding by topic and to discover whether various demographic factors may have an influence on that understanding. Within the survey sample, it appeared that the demographic factors tested did not generally affect students' understanding of source code plagiarism. However, analysis of the data for specific topics revealed that there are several areas of activity where the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable behavior is not clearly understood. These findings have implications for plagiarism education programs.", "authors": [{"name": "Jane Sinclair", "affiliation": "Computer Science Department, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"}, {"name": "Georgina Cosma", "affiliation": "P.A.

From the pedagogical point of view, two problems arise in these laboratories. First, students have some difficulties in understanding the link between discrete and programmable design techniques. Second, using only a single PLD, students are not automatically forced to learn modular design skills, which is one of the required learning outcomes in electrical engineering (EE) curricula. To overcome these problems, an innovative laboratory is proposed in this paper. Each training board contains four complex PLDs (CPLDs) and peripherals. In the initial sessions, students implement designs in which CPLDs are programmed as standard SSI/MSI chips and interconnected to construct the target circuit. Then, an active learning technique is used: Students form groups of any size and can set themselves more complex problems and choose their design approach. The proposed laboratory was set up at the Technical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, and the first classes were given in the 2008-2009 academic year.

Partnering in groups of two or three, second-year electrical and computer engineering and biomedical engineering students used MATLAB graphical user interface programs, complemented with their own original MATLAB code, to design filters suitable for achieving a filter bank decomposition of an audio signal. Rather than using the envelope-detected output for direct electrical stimulation of auditory nerve fibers as in an implant, the students reconstructed the signal by modulating sinusoids to yield an acoustic simulation. To appreciate the impact of filter order on sound intelligibility, students were asked to reconstruct signals using 4-16 filter channels for both speech and music and to examine the results critically. The lab served as a substrate upon which to solidify fundamental signal processing concepts such as the distinction between time and frequency domains, constructing and interpreting spectrograms, sampling, spectral decomposition, filtering, and reconstruction. In the spirit of PBL, the students examined engineering tradeoffs and discussed implementations when they were asked to consider realizing a significantly higher channel count (128-channel) device. To determine how the laboratory exercise impacted student learning and comprehension, as well as the level of student engagement achieved with this compelling application, an anonymous online survey was administered at the end of the course.

The teaching methodology involves delivering theoretical lectures on concepts related to PD and its measurements, along with laboratory experiments, assignments, open presentation, and so on. The evaluation methodology comprises examinations, both oral and written reports, and an assessment of the effectiveness of teamwork and of the course itself by means of student feedback. Analysis of student feedback showed that the students liked the course and felt it would be helpful for their professional advancement.", "authors": [{"name": "Debangshu Dey", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"}, {"name": "Biswendu Chatterjee", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"}, {"name": "Sivaji Chakravorti", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India"}], "tags": ["computer aided instruction", "Education", "partial discharge phenomenon teaching", "student experiments", "education", "Noise", "PD measurement technique", "ABET criteria", "educational courses", "modular approach", "electrical power equipment", "partial discharge", "partial discharge measurement", "laboratory experiments", "predictive maintenance tool", "teaching methodology", "partial discharge monitoring", "electrical maintenance", "Discharges", "power engineering education", "student feedback", "Resistors", "Partial discharges", "Laboratories", "Detectors"]}, {"title": "Using Tablet PCs and Interactive Software in IC Design Courses to Improve Learning", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5710016/", "abstract": "This paper describes an initial study of using tablet PCs and interactive course software in integrated circuit (IC) design courses.

The GTA modules are independent, and each is a self-contained game-like programming assignment that challenges students on concepts pertaining to a specific curriculum topic area. A faculty member can selectively pick and choose a subset of GTA modules to experiment with and gradually adopt the materials in his or her own classes. Each GTA module also includes a step-by-step tutorial guide that supports and encourages interested faculty to develop their own expertise and game-themed materials. This paper begins with a survey of previous results. Based on this survey, the paper summarizes the important considerations when designing materials for selective adoption. The paper then describes the design, implementation, and assessment of the GTA modules. The results from ongoing GTA workshops for CS1/2 faculty members and from a yearlong project in adopting the GTA modules in classes are then presented. In this case, the collected results verified that introductory programming concepts can be examined, practiced, and learned by means of GTA modules when neither the faculty nor the students involved have backgrounds in graphics or games. More importantly, these results demonstrated that it is straightforward to blend the GTA modules into existing classes with minimum alterations.

For instance, the programming layer has been brought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and \u03bcC/OS-II such that it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition to linking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, users can program the codes not only in C language, but also through visual programming by means of a graphic interface developed along with the platform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot function design. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping in robotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated with the platform has been designed and used in classes.
