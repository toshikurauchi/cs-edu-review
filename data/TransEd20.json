[{"title": "Incidence of Digital Competences in the Completion Rates of MOOCs: Case Study on Energy Sustainability Courses", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9003538/", "abstract": "Contribution: This article analyzes the correlation between users' digital competencies and their tendencies to successfully complete energy sustainability massive online open courses (MOOCs). In addition to reviewing whether digital competencies are a predictor of the effective completion of the course, this article analyzes whether participants acquire higher levels of digital competence through interaction in the course. Background: Completion rates of MOOCs typically range between 5% and 8%, with respect to registered participants. According to the literature, low rates may be due to factors such as students' lack of motivation or digital competence limitations. Research Questions: RQ1: Is there a correlation between the level of digital competence declared by the participants and their tendency to successfully complete the MOOC? RQ2: Does participation in a MOOC improve participants' digital competencies? Methodology: Two surveys, one pretest and one post-test (before and after the MOOCs), were applied to assess the digital competence levels of the participants. The total population of participants in the 12 MOOCs was 123 124 unique users, from which 9075 participants (pretest) - 7.37% of the universe - and 6029 participants (post-test) - 35.70% of the universe - were extracted as a sample. To determine its internal consistency, an exploratory factorial analysis was performed on both instruments and a Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.8 was obtained in all of its dimensions. Findings: A significant level of moderate to high correlation between the declared levels of digital competence and the trend toward successful completion of the MOOCs under study was observed. However, a significant increase was not demonstrated in the levels of digital competence acquired in the interaction with MOOCs. Conclusions: The level of digital competence of a participant in a MOOC was a valid predictor of their tendency to finish it. Although no increase in the levels of digital competence acquired through MOOCs was demonstrated, this may be because the subject matter of the MOOCs was alien to the indicators and dimensions of the digital competence. Further research could analyze the effectiveness of MOOCs in terms of digital competition at the acquired levels of competition.", "authors": [{"name": "Luis M.

This article also addresses the scarcity of research that explores the effects of in-class activity organization. Background: When facing a subject they perceive as dry or difficult, some students may feel discouraged from making an effort to learn. Previous research has shown that students have a positive attitude toward assignment tiering, as a form of scaffolding, in voluntary, take-home assignments. Related models either are designed for different settings or have obvious problems with applicability in flipped learning environments. Intended Outcomes: A lab environment that motivates students to learn and consequently to perform better on in-class evaluations and on exams. The approach should be positively received by students. Application Design: Drawing upon the previous teaching experience, the proposed approach is a modification of an assignment tiering model found in the academic literature. With two gated tiered assignments per class, the steepness of the learning curve is alleviated for struggling students, while the injection of deliberate errors, reflexive questions, and ad hoc modification requests keep experienced students engaged with challenging tasks.

This paper addresses this under-researched connection between the use of portable learning technologies, incorporated into an Introduction to Computer Engineering course, and student retention. Background: The desire for active learning experiences has promoted the use of portable, hands-on technologies in classrooms and laboratories. However, published results from such efforts do not often assess the impact of such tools on student retention. In Fall 2015, the Kansas State University Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering overhauled an introductory computer engineering course, incorporating portable learning tools with the aims to increase student retention, where a secondary focus related to helping students understand the limitations of portable hardware platforms. Intended Outcomes: The goal was to improve student confidence and the retention of first- and second-year students who took the course. Application Design: Laboratory exercises used portable technologies and focused on hardware limitations. Summative surveys helped to quantify the impact of the new course structure on student confidence. The retention of first- and second-year students who took the course was also investigated.

Students develop their own laboratory procedures and explain their results. This approach creates a positive environment to improve students' problem-solving, and their control design and implementation skills. Background: Prior studies on undergraduate education in electric machines show that power systems control techniques are mostly approached as lectures and simulation tasks, which makes it difficult for students to apply these concepts in real situations. Several studies explored the impact of educational platforms on student learning of various power systems subjects, but further investigation is needed to analyze the influence of the instructional approaches used in applying these educational tools. Intended Outcomes: The h-PBL laboratory activities are intended to foster student learning of power system control by replacing the teacher-led approach with a focus on student-centered real-world applications.

It considers two aspects: 1) students' motivation and affective state and 2) students' observations and perception of Fab Lab-based learning. Background: Fab Labs are described as small workshops equipped with a set of computer-controlled tools (e.g., 3-D printers) that offer personalized digital fabrication. They have been shown to have a positive impact on learners' academic and personal growth when used in extracurricular activities, but little research examines whether integrating Fab Labs into school curricula can help raise student interest in STEAM education. Research Question: Can Fab Lab-based learning foster students' interest in STEM in primary and secondary schools? Would students be keen to use Fab Labs in their science classes? Methodology: Two case studies were carried out in two different schools as part of the European Horizon 2020 NEWTON project. The study had 39 participants; three different surveys were used to assess different constructs. Findings: Results show that after using the Fab Lab-based learning: 1) students felt more interested in science classes as well as more engaged and less bored and 2) while some students struggled at first when manipulating Fab Lab tools, they adapted quickly and reported that they would like to use Fab Labs as part of their science classes.", "authors": [{"name": "Gabriel-Miro Muntean", "affiliation": "Performance Engineering Laboratory, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland"}, {"name": "Gianluca Cornetta", "affiliation": "Universidad San Pablo\u2014CEU, Campus de Monteprincipe Alcorc\u00f3n, Madrid, Spain"}, {"name": "Covadonga Lorenzo", "affiliation": "Universidad San Pablo\u2014CEU, Campus de Monteprincipe Alcorc\u00f3n, Madrid, Spain"}, {"name": "Mohammed Amine Togou", "affiliation": "Performance Engineering Laboratory, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland"}], "tags": ["Tools", "educational courses", "fab lab-based learning", "3-D modeling", "fab lab tools", "electronic engineering education", "Printers", "engagement", "EU Horizon 2020 NEWTON project", "STEAM education", "Education", "Task analysis", "computer aided instruction", "educational institutions", "student experiments", "K-12 students", "computer-controlled tools", "collaborative learning", "NEWTON fabrication laboratory education", "Ceramics", "science-technology-engineering-art-and-mathematics", "computer science education", "K???12 education", "students motivation", "STEM", "Fabrication", "digital fabrication", "Teamwork"]}, {"title": "Using Continuous Peer Evaluation in Team-Based Engineering Capstone Projects: A Case Study", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9007387/", "abstract": "Scholarship of Application. Background: Capstone courses constitute the culminating experience in engineering curricula. A core characteristic is the student team and project-based nature, with many team deliverables. The ensuing difficulty is to fairly assess the individual team member's contribution toward the team effort. Contribution: The method presented here is based on weekly peer evaluation of the individual team member's contribution, which subsequently yields a participation factor (PF), in turn scaling the team grade in accordance with the individual student performance. Intended Outcome: This method allows the timely adjustment of the individual student effort to match the group expectations and rewards high-performing students by making higher individual grades than the team average possible, while penalizing underperforming free riders by not benefiting from other student's performance. Application Design: The method allows students to continuously calibrate their own and their teammate's expectations and improve their peer score by adjusting their individual efforts. This feedback also requires students to practice professional communication, and in particular giving and receiving critical feedback, and thus is highly aligned with industry needs. Findings: Results evaluated over three iterations of the assessment process indicate a weak positive correlation (0.26) of the peer evaluation with the individual instructor-graded deliverables as well as the individual student grade point average (GPA, 0.23). Further, survey-based data indicate student agreement that the PF is a fair reflection of the individual performance, and a neutral perceived overall assessment system effectiveness, with reported primary barriers being the difficulty in assigning fair peer grades and of open, critical discussion.", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew J.

The course design aligns with best practices for promoting development of students' self-efficacy in solving ill-structured software design problems. Background: From Jonassen's theory, problem-solving outcomes are dependent on the problem structure, complexity, and representation; and the characteristics of the solver. These characteristics are diverse, including knowledge, familiarity, and psychometric qualities of the solver (e.g., self-efficacy and motivation). Thus, better problem-solving outcomes are dependent on the development of these traits, and on the problem characteristics. Intended Outcomes: Pre-2010, course learning activities and assessments overly focused on syntax. The course was redesigned with a focus on ill-structured problem solving and design in high-fidelity problem domains. Application Design: Complex and ill-structured lecture examples, assignments, and exams were redesigned to reinforce the importance of software design and problem solving. An open-ended cornerstone project using robotics was added as a structured means of providing students practice with solving ill-structured and open-ended problems. The assignment and exam questions, with the course cornerstone project, achieve instructional alignment in the course.

The proposal has been evaluated through the grades of the students, as well as the perception of both students and instructors, and the results obtained allow to confirm the benefits of the proposal.", "authors": [{"name": "Carlos Santos-P\u00e9rez", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain"}, {"name": "Marta Marr\u00f3n-Romera", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain"}, {"name": "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rodr\u00edguez-Ascariz", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain"}, {"name": "Cristina Losada-Guti\u00e9rrez", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain"}, {"name": "Felipe Espinosa", "affiliation": "University of Alcal\u00e1, Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, Spain"}], "tags": ["Educational robots", "Tools", "Proposals", "Computer-aided instruction", "engineering education", "control engineering", "Control engineering", "Training", "remote control"]}, {"title": "Measuring the Programming Self-Efficacy of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Students", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9031745/", "abstract": "Contribution: This article has shown that self-efficacy in performing complex computer programming tasks and the self-regulation of electrical and electronics engineering undergraduate students varies with respect to the class standing and prior experience in computer programming. Background: Computer programming is an essential skill that all engineers must possess, as most industries require engineers to own this skill. Prior studies discuss programming self-efficacy (PSE) measures; however, these studies do not specifically measure the PSE of electrical and electronics engineering major in the Indian context. Research Questions: The overarching research question of this article is: What factors related to participants' demographics, vicarious experiences, and performance accomplishments influence the PSE of electrical and electronics engineering students in India? Methodology: To answer the above research question, a study is conducted using quantitative methods in engineering education research. This article focuses on the development of a survey instrument to measure the PSE of electrical and electronics engineering students of India. The survey includes a total of 31 items, content validity and face validity were established. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted, and the final two factors are \u201cbasic programming tasks and dependence\u201d and \u201ccomplex programming tasks and self-regulation.\u201d A multiple regression analysis was performed to find the best fitting model for the two factors. Findings: The regression model with \u201cbasic programming tasks and dependence\u201d was not statistically significant and the regression model with \u201ccomplex programming tasks and self-regulation\u201d was found to be statistically significant with predictors class standing and prior programming experience.", "authors": [{"name": "Javeed Kittur", "affiliation": "Engineering Education Systems and Design Program, Arizona State University, Mesa, USA"}], "tags": ["India", "educational courses", "factor analysis", "electronic engineering education", "PSE", "Engineering students", "complex programming tasks", "basic programming tasks", "student background", "engineering education", "electronic engineering computing", "multiple regression analysis", "complex computer programming tasks", "Java", "Task analysis", "computer aided instruction", "exploratory factor analysis", "gender", "electrical electronics engineering undergraduate students", "programming self-efficacy (PSE)", "Electrical engineering", "Programming profession", "Electric variables measurement", "engineering education research", "computer science education", "Instruments", "programming self-efficacy", "prior programming experience", "regression", "self-regulation", "programming", "self-efficacy measures", "regression analysis", "quantitative method"]}]
