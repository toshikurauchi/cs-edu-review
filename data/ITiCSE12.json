In fact, never before in human history were incredibly powerful and versatile computing devices such as smartphones available and adopted so broadly. We propose that computer programming, and thus the teaching of programming, can and should be done directly on the mobile devices themselves, without the need for a separate PC or laptop to write code.

The purpose of this paper is to profile students with different study modes, the profiling being based on a structured questionnaire. In this way we try to find out what are the factors that affect the study mode. Our investigation focuses on both the effect of internal factors, such as motivation, and the effect of external factors, such as distance and time limitations, in the choice of a study method.", "authors": [{"name": "Mikko Myllym\u00e4ki", "affiliation": "University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kokkola, Finland"}, {"name": "Ismo Hakala", "affiliation": "University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Kokkola, Finland"}], "tags": ["student profile", "study mode", "lecture video", "blended learning"]}, {"title": "cs4fn: a flexible model for computer science outreach", "link": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2325296.2325366", "abstract": "There are a variety of initiatives to attract secondary school students to computer science. cs4fn is one such project. It combines a magazine, website and live shows, telling stories about computer science in spirited and creative ways. Here we focus on the use of the magazine and, using sociolinguistic discourse analysis, we analyze comments from students and teachers to understand why they have requested (free) subscriptions to the magazine and how they plan to use it. Our analysis shows that both students and teachers are attracted to the flexibility that cs4fn provides, and use it in a variety of learning contexts. We find that the flexibility of the magazine makes it a valuable tool to engage students and teachers and that they use it to further enthuse others (i.e., other students and teachers). We suggest that cs4fn magazine is a powerful form of outreach and that this approach can be widely disseminated within computer science and other academic disciplines, raising the profile of computing to both students and teachers, and spreading enthusiasm for computer science.", "authors": [{"name": "Laura R.
