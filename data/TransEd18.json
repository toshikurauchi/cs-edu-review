[{"title": "The Impact of Digital Technology on Female Students\u2019 Learning Experience in Partition-Rooms: Conditioned by Social Context", "link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8378045/", "abstract": "Contribution: As expected, a partition-room environment negatively affects students' learning. An unexpected result of this study is that female students occasionally choose not to use the technology available in partition-rooms, to avoid undesirable facial exposure. Background: The main purpose of partition-rooms is to prevent male instructors from seeing female students' faces. In learning environments where instructors and students are physically separated, technology is expected to play an integral role in bridging the gap. In one side of partition-rooms, female students use their own mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones, for course activities and communication; in the other side, the instructor has various digital teaching equipment provided by the institution. Research Question: What effect does a partition-room's physical environment have on female students' academic performance, satisfaction, technology efficacy, and perceived learning? What effect does a partition-room's social environment have on female students' academic performance, satisfaction, technology efficacy, and perceived learning? Methodology: Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were followed. Quantitative results were obtained from a student questionnaire. Qualitative data was gathered in a focus group session. Findings: The communication benefits offered by technology are impaired by both the physical context and the cultural-social context. The latter emerged during focus group discussions where students said that their faces might by revealed in the light emitted by their devices. Thus, local culture and social context limit the benefits of using digital technology in the classroom.", "authors": [{"name": "Mariam A.

It is difficult to teach, however, as it requires a fundamental revision of the assumptions and laws of classical physics and probability. Furthermore, introductory QM courses and texts predominantly focus on the mathematical formulations of the subject and lay less emphasis on its conceptual understanding. Consequently, students struggle to build robust mental models of the concepts. This paper posits that games can provide an effective platform for an experiential and conceptual understanding of introductory QM. Games are particularly suitable for demonstrating QM characteristics because their repetitive nature is conducive to demonstrating probability concepts that form a core part of QM. Games can also immerse students in an engaging environment that motivates them to learn. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a digital game for learning introductory QM concepts. The evaluation of the game indicates an improvement in students' conceptual understanding of probability.

Background: Increasing the number of under-represented minorities pursuing degrees in science and engineering through formal and informal learning activities has been a focus in the United States for many years. Efforts to diversify the engineering workforce have often targeted students in high school and college (ages 15-22), with varying success. Intended Outcomes: This program was designed to increase participants' content knowledge, interest in STEM courses, interest in STEM careers, interest in attending college, and improve their attitudes about STEM. Application Design: Approaches used included: 1) introducing software tools that encouraged critical thinking, creativity and independent learning; 2) integrating engineering and software design processes; 3) providing projects that were age- and culturally-appropriate; and 4) using ethnically matched mentors. Findings: After almost two years in the program participants show improved attitudes toward STEM, more interest and career choices in computing and engineering, and increased interest in attending college.

Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field.

This approach covers the ten PM knowledge areas, guiding students through the planning of software projects. Background: Because software PM is unfeasible without the support of a PM tool there is a growing demand that these tools be taught in the higher education computer courses. Hence, several approaches already have been proposed to improve this teaching, such as educational PM tools or simulators, which facilitate the application of specific PM techniques and the treatment of their results. Another approach to improve the teaching of PM tools is instructional feedback, but little information is as yet available on how to provide instructional feedback when teaching software PM. Intended Outcomes: Instructional feedback, essential to helping students to learn, is based on an evaluation of their actions and decisions. To take advantage of this instructional approach, this paper proposes an instructional feedback technique to be employed in an instructional unit (IU) teaching PM tools aligned with the project management body of knowledge. Application Design: This technique was evaluated through an experiment carried out in undergraduate computer courses. Control and experiential groups were exposed to the same IU, with only the experiential group using the instructional feedback technique.

Background: Interest is increasing in incorporating virtual laboratories in engineering curricula. Numerous studies report equal or greater gains in students' conceptual understanding in a virtual laboratory than a corresponding physical laboratory, but many researchers question if virtual laboratories can stimulate the same level of excitement for engineering as physical laboratories. Research Questions: Do students' self-reports of interest in engineering depend on the instructional design afforded by the laboratory mode? How do instructional designs of virtual and physical laboratory projects relate to students' perceptions of engagement, their contribution to the team, and the transfer of prior coursework to meet project objectives? Method: In a within-subjects design, 118 students' interest and engagement in two physical laboratory projects and one of two virtual laboratory projects in a senior-year capstone course is investigated. Separate principal components analyses were used to develop reliable scales for interest and for engagement. Findings: Students reported greater engagement, perceptions of contribution to their group's learning, opportunities to transfer prior learning from coursework, and end-of-course interest in engineering problem solving in the virtual laboratory project rather than the physical laboratory projects.

The paradigm shift from electrical engineering to microelectronics graduate education has been slow, but the technology has now advanced to the point where industry is relying on cyber-physical connectivity, thus providing an opportunity for engineering education to utilize this capability. Research Questions: How are methods deployed when teaching traditional electrical engineering degrees still applicable in microelectronics education, and how are globally ranked institution shifting their online teaching and learning pedagogies for this? Methodology: A survey is presented of current trends in Master's degree programs in microelectronics and related fields, and in electrical engineering degree programs with specialization in microelectronics. The review reveals how Quacquarelli Symonds' top-ranked world universities, and other global universities with established micro- and nanoelectronic degrees, are selecting modules for their curricula and curricula content in attempts to attract and develop engineering students to this specialized field. Findings: The current global trend toward microelectronic education is following a part-coursework, part-dissertation Master's degree model, consisting of several core modules, several electives, a research proposal writing module and a mini-dissertation.

Existing research has found that instructional use of computational models that move from abstract to concrete representations can foster students' comprehension of electric circuit concepts, but other features of effective instruction using computational models need further investigation.

Understanding differences in how graders approach such questions can help the CS education community become more informed about how to design valid assessments for summative and formative purposes. Research Questions: Do graders differ significantly in how they score student programs? What are the main factors to which differences between graders could be attributed? Methodology: A number of CS1 instructors and TAs were asked to score pieces of code resembling student solutions to CS1 exam questions, and were asked to answer open ended questions on how they approach grading in CS1 exams.

These difficulties resulted in low performance. Intended Outcomes: To support, or scaffold, problem-solving in subsequent semesters, a strategy of frequent and timely monitoring and feedback was used. The hypotheses were that these scaffolding strategies would be associated with enhanced performance on open-ended projects, and would support students in similar future work once removed. Application Design: Based upon strategies from the scaffolding literature, assignments that guided problem decomposition were used. Flipped instruction challenged students to prepare for the laboratory by reviewing worked programming examples and completing online assessments. The laboratory sessions were reserved for collaborative, hands-on programming, with instructor oversight, as in a problem-based learning environment. Students submitted frequent progress reports for self-monitoring and feedback throughout each project. Findings: A statistical comparison of project scores across semesters revealed performance improvements with scaffolding.

Background: Extensive work has been put into the development of simple, low-cost educational tools to improve learning by supplementing curricula with hands-on experiences. Several devices, including haptic paddles, have been developed to combine dynamics and mechatronics content which culminate in rendering virtual environments. Despite demonstrated student interest in haptic devices and the foundational role of CE in learning, experimental comparisons of learning outcomes over a broad range of devices have had mixed results. Intended Outcomes: Device design can only address the experience portions of the learning cycle-effort put into encouraging and mediating a reflection phase will improve student performance.

It also confirms the short term benefits of partnerships at scale. Background: Engineers often work in teams, both in industry and in academia. Previous work has shown that partnered programming yields higher student performance during the course in which students partner. Research Questions: This paper investigates the long term effects of early curriculum pair programming on student performance in a following course. Specifically, do student partnerships impact long-term student performance in a later course? Are previously observed effects of partner programming robust to a larger sample size? Methodology: This quantitative analysis examines 2468 students in an introductory computer science sequence at a large, public research institution. The data set comprises two academic years and includes partnership participation, project and exam scores, withdraw rates, time between courses, GPA, and gender. Findings: A positive relationship is observed between partnering in an introductory course, and higher project scores in a future course, where all students worked alone (N=1003). Students with the lowest GPAs experienced the greatest benefits. Additionally, results with a large population of students confirm the observations of previous research, showing that partnerships are associated with an overall positive grade impact during the course in which the partnership takes place (N=2468).", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew DeOrio", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}, {"name": "Max O.

Background: A major difficulty that programming students must overcome-the learning of recursion-has been addressed by many authors, using various approaches, but none have considered how students perceive this issue. Research Questions: 1) How can an instrument be developed to characterize the main difficulties students encounter, from their subjective perspective, when learning recursion? and 2) How can the quality of the developed instrument be determined? Methodology: 1) A development process was followed to create the instrument. This process included justification of the content, and a quality analysis of the instrument in terms of validity and reliability and 2) the study was on a limited number of students, so should be regarded as preliminary with respect to validity and reliability of results. Findings: 1) An initial survey indicates the magnitude of the recursion problem from the students' point of view; 2) students' perception is that neither motivation, nor their previous knowledge of theoretical concepts on recursion, are factors that affect their learning of the recursion process; and 3) for further statistical analysis, data from a simplified survey proved more valid and more reliable than that from the original survey, for the study sample examined.", "authors": [{"name": "Carmen Lacave", "affiliation": "Department of Technology and Information Systems, Universidad of Castilla-La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"}, {"name": "Miguel A.

The widespread adoption of learner-centered teaching methods that address this issue faces certain barriers, including: 1) the significant faculty effort necessary to prepare e-learning materials; 2) significant extra time required for active online communication with students; 3) student resistance to taking an active role in their education; and 4) lecturers' common belief that learner-centered teaching activities do not allow discussion of all the required topics. This paper presents a case study based on one offering of an introductory digital systems course taught with a combination of learner-centered strategies selected to overcome these barriers and improve student performance. These measures included: 1) improving the student-teacher relationship; 2) applying intriguing, inductive, and counterintuitive approaches to introducing new concepts; 3) adopting puzzle-based quizzes integrated with peer instruction; 4) using an audience response system; 5) replacing certain lectures with tutorials; 6) reducing course duration; and 7) using a graphics tablet.

Background: Studies find that men and women report taking on different roles in PBL projects, and that there is a relationship between team gender breakdown and students' satisfaction with PBL teams, with teams less happy with the inclusion of more women. Both male and female students on teams with two or more women report lower team satisfaction than men on teams of just men, or men and women on teams with a single woman Research Questions: How do students self-select, negotiate, and allocate tasks on PBL teams? How does past PBL experience influence task allocation? How does gender affect task allocation? Methodology: First-year students (N = 60) completed reflections about task assignment during a semester-long PBL experience.

Background: Audio engineering has historically been male-dominated; while the number of non-male audio engineers has increased recently, the industry mindset has changed very little. Studies into the gender diversity of this field are required, to force a shift in mindset and create a more inclusive environment. Research Questions: To what extent is there an imbalance in the representation of different genders at audio engineering conferences? Do conference topic, presentation type, or author position have an impact on the gender balance? Methodology: A novel method was designed to obtain pronouns of authors where possible, avoiding removal of data or potential false positives. The main limitation of this methodology is the time required for gender determination. Gender composition was analyzed across 20 conferences, with gender balance further analyzed within four key categories: 1) conference topic; 2) presentation type; 3) position in the author byline; and 4) the number of authors. Findings: This paper demonstrates a clear lack of gender diversity in conference authorship in audio engineering.

Background: Women and low socio-economic classes have historically been under-represented, both as students and teachers. Various policies and measures are being put in place internationally to raise their standing, equity, and success as they progress in their careers. To be effective, the after effects of these policies must be investigated and understood. Research Questions: This paper addressed the question of whether gender and socio-economic differences, in both teachers and students, affect students' opinion of their teachers in higher education, across a number of disciplines. Methodology: The research analyzed the differentials in students' ratings of their teachers in five disciplines in the field of education. Data was drawn from student responses to the surveys conducted in a large Indian university at the end of each course unit. The survey questions elicit their perceptions of teaching quality in the disciplines of civil engineering, electrical engineering, computer science engineering, mathematics, humanities and social sciences. This paper analyzes 112 919 and 16 354 complete sets of student ratings, to study the gender and socio-economic diversity based effects respectively. Statistical multivariate and univariate general linear models were used to derive the relevant results and graphs.

AL is important because of its positive impact on learning, and should be used to some degree in STEM courses. Fortunately, AL can be incorporated into a course in numerous ways, from the simple to the complex. Simple approaches, such as think-pair-share (TPS), often require little or no preparation. Intended Outcomes: The instructor intended to enhance his teaching approach and associated learning outcomes using simple techniques after attending an AL workshop. This case study contributes to the literature on post-workshop adoption of AL, as recently called for. Application Design: The repeated use of simple AL (i.e., TPS, minute paper, and pair programming) was implemented in a digital logic and computer organization/assembly language course sequence. Both courses had previously been taught by the same instructor using lecture only. Exam results in the active semester were compared to previous results, using GPA as a control variable. Findings: Significantly higher exam scores were obtained during the active semester in both courses. The techniques were indirectly assessed by content analysis of student interviews with a research-supported coding scheme; the great majority of students perceived the techniques as helpful to learning, with most citing the ability to converse and work with their classmates to solve problems. The instructor's main observation from his inaugural use of these techniques is that they led to overall gains, and required little or no preparation.", "authors": [{"name": "Samuel J.

Less active learning methods such as homework and peer reviews are investigated, as well as a newly introduced very active (constructive) learning method called \u201cslectures,\u201d and some others. The results suggest that graduate students' perception of the usefulness of the activity increases with its level of activity. For undergraduate students, an increased perception of the usefulness of the activity was observed for lightly active but structured learning methods. Group-based analysis focusing on two types of learners, defined as \u201cinstructor-dependent\u201d and \u201cinstructor-independent\u201d according to their perception of the usefulness of the classroom lectures, was also performed. The results suggest that instructor-independent learners may benefit more from active learning methods than instructor-dependent learners. For example, instructor-independent undergraduate learners were found to perceive the homework assignment as being more useful than the lectures. Such a preference was not seen in the average group data. In fact, no learning method was found to be perceived as more useful than the lectures, on average.
