[{"title": "Work in progress: A machine learning approach for assessment and prediction of teamwork effectiveness in software engineering education", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462205", "abstract": "One of the challenges in effective software engineering (SE) education is the lack of objective assessment methods of how well student teams learn the critically needed teamwork practices, defined as the ability: (i) to learn and effectively apply SE processes in a teamwork setting, and (ii) to work as a team to develop satisfactory software (SW) products. In addition, there are no effective methods for predicting learning effectiveness in order to enable early intervention in the classroom. Most of the current approaches to assess achievement of SE teamwork skills rely solely on qualitative and subjective data taken as surveys at the end of the class and analyzed only with very rudimentary data analysis. In this paper we present a novel approach to address the assessment and prediction of student learning of teamwork effectiveness in software engineering education based on: a) extracting only objective and quantitative student team activity data during their team class project; b) pairing these data with related independent observations and grading of student team effectiveness in SE process and SE product components in order to create \u201ctraining database\u201d and c) applying a machine learning (ML) approach, namely random forest classification (RF), to the above training database in order to create ML models, ranked factors and rules that can both explain (e.g. assess) as well as provide prediction of the student teamwork effectiveness. These student team activity data are being collected in joint and already established (since 2006) SE classes at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Fulda University, Germany (Fulda), from approximately 80 students each year, working in about 15 teams, both local and global (with students from multiple schools).", "authors": [{"name": "Aishwarya Iyer", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Shihong Huang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, USA"}, {"name": "Rainer Todtenhoefer", "affiliation": "Department of Applied Computer Science, Fulda University of Applied Science, Fulda, Germany\u00a0"}, {"name": "Dragutin Petkovic", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Kazunori Okada", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Shenhaochen Zhu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Marc Sosnick", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["teamwork", "machine learning", "software", "software engineering teamwork", "software engineering education", "educational institutions", "training", "software engineering", "assessment"]}, {"title": "Teaching software inspection effectiveness: An active learning exercise", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462206", "abstract": "This paper discusses a novel active learning exercise which teaches students how to perform and assess the effectiveness of formal software inspections. In this exercise, students are responsible for selecting an artifact from their senior capstone design projects. The students then use fault injection to strategically place faults within the artifact that should be caught by the inspection exercise. Based on the needs of the team, students prepare an inspection packet consisting of a set of inspection instructions, applicable checklists, and the inspection artifact. Students then \u201chire\u201d a set of inspectors based on classmates' backgrounds and experiences. The team leader then holds two inspection meetings and reports the results. The results are then used to assess the effectiveness of the inspection. Overall, in analyzing 5 years worth of data from this exercise, it is found that students are capable of selecting appropriate materials for inspection and performing appropriate software inspections. The yield of students is lower than an experienced professional might have and the inspection rates tend to be slightly higher than desired for their experience. However, the yield is related to individual preparation time. Students overall find this to be a highly educational experience and highly recommend it be continued for future classes.", "authors": [{"name": "Walter W.

Most institutions assess learning using a score-based grading system. Such systems use multiple individual assignment scores to produce a cumulative final course grade, which may or may not represent what a student has learned. Standards-based grading offers an alternative that addresses the need to directly assess how well students are developing toward meeting the course objectives. The course objectives are the focal point of the grading system, allowing the instructor to assess students on clearly defined objectives throughout the course. The system assesses how well students become proficient in the course objectives over the duration of the course. This study extends the use of standards-based grading at the K-12 level into the realm of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Five STEM courses pilot tested the integration of a standards-based grading system to investigate how it impacts affective and cognitive student behaviors.

In this ongoing mixed-methods investigation, we draw on existing motivation and self-regulated learning theories to examine how undergraduate students at a small private college and a large public university become more self-directed as they progress through the first two years of their engineering programs. Preliminary findings indicate that first-year students at the two institutions report significant differences in their motivations and goal orientations. Students at the small private college express higher intrinsic motivation and learning orientation, and lower external regulation and grade orientation, compared to students at the large public university.

Mind maps consist of words and connections between words, and this visual tool helps illustrate how an individual understands how these words connect together in a field. From an analysis standpoint, mind maps are graphs consisting of nodes connected by edges. In the fall of 2011, students created three mind maps over the duration of a digital system design course, and at each of the three intervals, these mind maps were created with the same 20 terms that were introduced throughout the course. Each student's mind maps were then digitally encoded and analyzed using a modern graph analysis tool called GraphCrunch II. Our results show that a simple analysis of graph density is a poor indicator of learning since this metric does not capture a graph's structure, and it is this structure that reflects meaning and understanding by the learner. Instead, a metric called relative graphlet frequency distance (RGF-distance), which is calculated by comparing a golden mind map (expert created mind map) to each of the students mind maps, is used to analyze each students understanding of how these words relate. Our results show that learner's mind maps decrease in RGF-distance over the period of the course, and this means that the students are building graphs more similar to that of the golden model. We, also, see that the RGF-distance over the set of students compared to their grades on an exam or overall grade in the course has some correlation, meaning that these mind maps relate to grades in terms of the learners understanding of vocabulary, but the correlation is not strong.

A humanoid robotics workshop is included as a part of the curriculum of \u2018Industrial Robotics\u2019 in the Industrial Engineering. This workshop covers one third of the laboratory practices of this subject. A constructivist view for learning is adopted, whereby robotic technologies are not seen as mere tools, but rather as potential vehicles of new ways of thinking about teaching, learning and education at large. Students, in a constructivist learning environment, are invited to work on experiments and authentic problem-solving; with selective use of available resources according to their own interests, research and learning strategies. The authors, as trainers of this workshop, chose ROBONOVA humanoid robots, among other devices, which attempt to partner technology with ideas of constructivism. The materials used in the workshop offer building parts, sensors thus connecting a robot with the external environment and programming software with a simple graphical interface intended for the creation of robot behavioral movements. The idea is \u201clearning by design\u201d, which is central in the constructivist pedagogy introduced firstly by Resnick. In this workshop we corroborate this idea through the project-based learning approach in robotics.

Workplace stresses can have significant financial impact both on university budgets and the overall economy due to poor decision-making, health issues and accidents resulting from illness. Engineering academics that teach and/or research within higher education institutions have been reported anecdotally to have a high prevalence of stress. The actual (self-perceived) level however has been largely unquantified. The research reported in this paper was conducted to assess self-perceived stress levels and identify the stress factors within a cohort of engineering academics at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), a small regionally based Australian university renowned for its distance education. The questionnaire was applied using a mix of validated and non-validated survey instruments and incorporated a set of questions previously applied at the University of Adelaide (UoA). Findings from USQ are broadly in line with those independently reported elsewhere for Australia and the UK, with some minor exceptions. In summary the USQ project indicates that engineering academics have higher perceived stress levels than the validated health threshold, with significant variation based on age, academic type (teaching-research), and for staff with English as a second language. The results from both universities also indicated that there are significant stress contributors related to the pressure to obtain grants and to publish and to the (low) resultant levels of recognition from employers for any success.

Identifying misconceptions can provide a basis for improved research-based curriculum development and implementation. The recognition of false beliefs and flawed mental models of these concepts can also contribute to theories of conceptual change. The purpose of this research was to identify misconceptions related to open channel flow. During spring and fall of 2011, out of 91 students from two sections of \u2018Water Resources Engineering\u2019 course, 50 students were interviewed, and 41 students were given a pre/post test. The goal of these open-ended interviews and pre/post-tests was to obtain detailed data on students understanding of open channel flow concepts. Results suggest students have misconceptions relating to the hydraulic and energy grade line (HGL/EGL), flow transitions, and flow profiles. Many students have the correct terms of the HGL and EGL but lack understanding of where the terms re on an open channel flow profile. A large percentage of tested students revealed false beliefs relating to transitions. For example, more than 50 percent of tested students drew a decrease in water depth for a subcritical drop, rather than an increase in depth. Students also had difficult in labeling subcritical, critical, and supercritical places along flow profiles and how water flows over or under different weir structures. Repairing these fundamental misconceptions is essential for students to be able to apply these concepts in diverse situations and learn more advanced topics.", "authors": [{"name": "Devlin Montfort", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Andrew Easley", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jennifer Adam", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Shane Brown", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Bernard Vanwie", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA"}], "tags": ["water resources", "context", "earth", "educational institutions", "conceptual change", "fluids", "interviews", "open channel flow", "misconceptions", "color"]}, {"title": "Development of the science technology engineering and mathematics \u2014 Active listening skills assessment (STEM-ALSA)", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462248", "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to develop the STEM Active Listening Skills Assessment (STEM-ALSA), a conceptually grounded instrument designed to measure four components of active listening, a key element of communication in an academic setting.

For a start, beyond the traditional multiple-choice and true/false responses, these advanced clickers provide several new question modalities that the traditional button-based clickers do not offer. It can be hypothesized that the rich interactions offered by touch-based devices can enhance student engagement even further than the traditional clickers currently do and contribute towards improvements in student learning. To explore this hypothesis, a study was designed to investigate the difference in concept retention among students who use the traditional versus rich classroom response systems (CRS).

In particular, to gauge the influence of one aspect of instruction, the use of interactive web-based course materials that had been developed for Statics, we administered the Force Concept Inventory at the start of the course, and the Statics Concept Inventory at the end of the course. Correlations and then linear regression were applied to study how conceptual knowledge measured at the end of the course depended on conceptual knowledge measured at the start and the amount of use of the web-based courseware. Usage of the web-based courseware was found to promote conceptual knowledge at the end of the course in a statistically significant way only after accounting for initial knowledge as judged by the different conceptual test administered at the start of the course.

We also discuss the initial phase of our curricular implementation strategy in two disciplinary engineering programs at MSU and transfer programs at LCC.", "authors": [{"name": "Daina Briedis", "affiliation": "Michigan State University East Lansing, MI\u00a0"}, {"name": "Neeraj Buch", "affiliation": "Michigan State University East Lansing, MI\u00a0"}, {"name": "Claudia E.

Our first year software engineering students have schedules filled with computer science, mathematics, science and humanities. The lack of any exposure to engineering meant some students, expressing a dislike for software engineering, left the program before they had any exposure to the discipline. To address this issue, we created a one credit Software Engineering Freshman Seminar, which all entering students take in their first term at RIT. This lets us insure student/faculty contact early in the program, as well as providing an opportunity to introduce engineering concepts and practices early in each student's program of study. This paper discusses the seminar's current incarnation. In particular, we focus on those aspects of the course which help students identify with software engineering as a profession. The challenge we face is achieving this goal with students whose technical knowledge and skills are modest. We have settled on an approach that provides experience with teamwork, requirements elicitation, and the effects of change, and addressing professional ethics. These in-class activities are complemented by an assignment to interview a practicing software engineer and to write an interview summary for discussion. This activity ensemble serves to disabuse students of the notion that software engineering is little more than programming, or that the discipline is identical to computer science.

At the same time a number of those involved in engineering course design have found it necessary to use the term philosophy when talking about the rationale for their courses.

This paper describes a course in engineering science at \u2018A\u2019 level for university entry in England and Wales that was epistemologically driven, and examines the extent to which it achieved its goals. The discussion is is prefaced by a short description of the system of selection to universities in England at the time of the development. At that time students seeking admission to university engineering departments were expected to have performed well in examinations that corresponded to first and or second year university courses in other parts of the world in physics, and pure and applied mathematics taken as separate subjects. It was proposed that physics should be replaced by engineering science. A major reason for this was the well documented attraction that students had for physics as opposed to engineering. It was argued by the product champion that more students would be attracted to engineering if they understood that it was a different way of thinking to physics. Thus the examination had to be equivalent to physics yet encourage a different way of thinking. It was found that in order to achieve this goal, different approaches to examining and assessment had to be introduced. It was also found that for curriculum goals to be achieved assessment had to become an integral part of the teaching-learning process rather than an afterthought.

Intermediate milestones given on the course website, impromptu instructor/team/mentor meetings next to computer monitors as well as an overhead projector screen, and exemplary portfolios of student work are considered essential for guiding team-based work on the final project. Significant personal growth in engineering graphics skills leading up to the final project and throughout the final project has been observed in an end-of-course surveys that explore many attributes of pre-cad sketching, part modeling, assembly modeling, and creation of engineering drawing packages.

There are two overarching components of our project. The first component required the transformation of the course structure from deductive practice to inductive practice. This element is supported by research results in STEM education and educational theory based on cognitive and social constructivism. The second component is the ICT support as there is an additional research base that supports connections between ICT enhanced collaborative learning, distributed cognition, and enhanced student outcomes. We propose that ICT support combined with immersion in an inductive teaching and learning environment will improve student outcomes more than either singular component case. The capabilities of the iPod Touch allowed us to build applications (apps) that utilize different multi-media formats. Eight different MSE apps have been built so far. The apps facilitate and support daily collaborative learning opportunities that target specific student learning objectives that are known to be challenging. Bi-weekly in-class, low-stakes quizzes help the students evaluate how well they are building their own knowledge base. Three kinds of data sets will be used to evaluate our research. Data set one is from deductive practice. Data set two is with inductive practice. The third data set, which we are now collecting, is similar to data set two, but with ICT support.

Many schools promote the use of physical models in their engineering curricula. Despite the apparent popularity of physical models, little is known about their cognitive impacts and when they should be implemented in the design process. A few studies have explored physical models and their use as idea generation tools; however the guidelines from them are conflicting. Based upon these conflicting guidelines, a series of controlled and qualitative studies are conducted by the authors to understand the cognitive impacts of physical models in engineering idea generation. In addition to the insights from these studies, data are collected from a project-based graduate design course. The reports from design teams prototyping their ideas as a part of a class project are studied. These reports provide insights about the conceptual errors that student designers make as they build and test physical models of their designs. To reduce the two most critical errors, a design method (Model Error Reduction Method) is formulated. This design method forces the designers to think about two potential conceptual errors in their designs and provides guidance to rectify the issues. The two conceptual errors that the method addresses are: failure to account for critical loads and failure to design connections. This paper presents a controlled experiment evaluating the effectiveness of the method. The preliminary results show that novice designers find the design method extremely useful; moreover, the method seems to help eliminate, to a large extent, said conceptual errors.

The questions were based around an epistemological framework currently in development, which includes six separate dimensions but allows for examination of the ties between the dimensions. Analysis was completed in multiple stages, and involved two researchers co-coding for inter-relater reliability. Most students viewed knowledge as very simple, certain and objective.

FYE graduates are the most likely to stick with their first choice of major (after completing FYE requirements), followed by DM graduates who begin in undesignated engineering (taking extra time to decide), then DM graduates who choose their major as part of the matriculation process, and then PGE graduates.

Specifically, we examine empirically how undergraduate engineering students care for others, as expressed through their writing about engineers taking responsibility for the adverse impacts on the environment and public health created by e-waste recycling in the developing world.

The professional development and understanding of appropriate theories needed to prepare materials and support student learning in these different teaching environments is often left to the academic to pursue independently, if at all. Whilst individual academics who revitalise courses in line with collaborative learning practices have the motivation, personality and teaching skills necessary to facilitate a class or groups of students, it may not be so for additional \u2018tutors\u2019 allocated to assist. Their differences in philosophy, personality and skills may have major impacts on the student learning experience. Even where tutors may be experienced academics in their own right, they may not fully understand the rationale and methods being employed and may need skill development. Professional development of academic staff is often overlooked in universities but it is vital for staff to engage in new learning and teaching practices and skill development if collaborative teaching strategies are to be sustained and make a positive contribution to the student learning journey. These factors become even more important as universities move into the online environment where meaningful engagement with the student cohort is significantly more than just making content available and having electronic submission of assignments.

However, there is little research to demonstrate how Research Based Instructional Strategies (RBIS) are being propagated from the developers to engineering faculty for use in the classroom. To examine the process of dissemination, this study uses Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation framework, which has traditionally been used to examine the dissemination of technological innovations through a population or organization. Rogers discusses five stages (knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation) of the innovation-decision process to explain how adopters make a decision about an innovation. To investigate faculty members' participation in the innovation-decision process, we conducted a survey of electrical, computer, and chemical engineering faculty (n = 221) teaching engineering sciences courses. The results show that ECE and ChE faculty members are located at a variety of stages throughout the innovation-decision process. However, most respondents have progressed past the knowledge phase; they are aware of the different RBIS. It is important to account for this when presenting an innovation or trying to encourage adoption of new practices, such as RBIS. It was found that workshops and presentations can influence the trial and use of RBIS when faculty are at the persuasion and decision stages. Also, women are more likely to try and use an RBIS than men.

This paper investigates the manner in which students reflected on their patterns of CT use within the collaborative setting. In general, these reflections were found to be superficial and descriptive, exhibiting a reductive view of CT as a set of technological features, which acted as a neutral medium for communication and participation. One consequence of this was a lack of awareness of the ways in which the technology influenced the behaviour of individual students or the collaborative nature of the group.

Taking into account the connection of the SST with the algebraic representation and the mathematical understanding of physical problems \u2014 electromagnetic radiation, scattering and inverse problems in our particular case \u2014, a generalized scheme of the SST (GSST) is currently under development. While the usual point of view of classical SST is valid for practical purposes, it usually avoids many important concepts which become fundamental in the generalization of the analysis of physical problems. Some examples of this generalization are concerned with representations of physical problems different from those in the usual time-frequency domains \u2014 using a general variable \u2014, the description of the problem in terms of infinite dimensional vector spaces and the algebra associated, the description of the Dirac delta function in terms of the distribution theory, etc. The most important purpose of obtaining a GSST is to connect the usual SST with important mathematical representations that lead to obtain more general representations that may be rigorously applied to model general physical problems. This generalized theory is focused on the algebraic concepts of signals and operators spaces, identifying each problem into their corresponding vector spaces and representing it in terms of the GSST scheme. One important point within this generalization is the concept of the Generalized Transform. Choosing a set of functions which play the role of a base, each signal of the space may be expressed in terms of a Generalized Linear Combination operator of this base weighted by a set of coefficients which identify the transform \u2014 their expression is directly related to the metric defined initially in the associated algebra \u2014. Spectral analysis of systems is also contemplated, representing the signals in terms of their coefficients once a set of basis functions is chosen. The generalized theory let to obtain integral characterizations of linear systems \u2014 invariant and non invariant \u2014, leading to the Generalized Spectral Analysis concept, closely connected to the operator theory. While the mathematical analysis of the GSST and its application, for instance to generalize the Green's function theory, has already been presented in several symposium \u2014 like 2009 IEEE AP and URSI Meeting \u2014, a software tool based on the GSST is being worked out in parallel to the theoretical works. The aim of this tool is to facilitate both students and practical scientific and engineers the understanding of the main algebraic concepts of this generalized scheme, providing some examples of many signals and many systems in five different signal spaces. The user can select the signal and the system with their appropriate parameters and analyze the properties of the systems as well as the output signal both in real and different spectral domains. The last version of this tool, SSTv4.5, lets to analyze linear non invariant systems and to visualize the set of impulse responses as well as the spectral analysis under some transformations such as Fourier, Hilbert or Bessel Transforms \u2014 depending on the signal space \u2014, thus exemplifying some particular cases of the Generalized Spectral Analysis.

Since people are a primary target, education is one of the \u201csecret weapons\u201d in the cyber security battlefield. Further, if everyday users are the targets, then all audiences, not just technical staff, need training and education in cyber security basics. We argue that computer security literacy is not only the next step in computer security defense; it may be one of the most important steps we can take. Through this workshop we want to encourage the profession to reach out to the populous and help make them security literate.

Major factors that facilitate the usage of SNS in e-learning were identified as collaboration, communication, resource sharing, social influence, usefulness and ease of use. Facebook was identified as the most popular SNS. The role of SNS in e-learning is supportive and important. Although the participants were computing students with a high level of IT literacy, and were interested in using SNS for e-learning, only a few were frequently using SNS for e-learning. Reasons for this minimal utilization of SNS for e-learning were identified as security and privacy concerns, reliability and currency of content and network issues such as speed of access, real time synchronization and efficiency. We believe that SNS can play a major supporting role in e-learning and that the potential for using SNS in e-learning is not fully reached. The situation may be improved by providing increased guidance and training to students. Learning activities using SNS should be planned and organized.

MEAs are realistic, open-ended, client-driven engineering problems designed to foster students' mathematical modeling abilities. The primary artifact produced by each team is a memo to the client describing a procedure for solving the engineering problem. Since 2007, three cycles of feedback and revision have been used in the course, with students receiving reviews from peers and teaching assistants (TAs) throughout the process. Prior to 2009, students received the first round of feedback from TAs, and the second from peers. After 2009, this order was reversed, and students received the first round of feedback from peers, and the second from TAs. This paper investigates whether the amount of change differed based on whether reviews were provided by TAs or by peers. Using the Levenshtein distance [1], the amount of change between consecutive drafts was calculated for four offerings of two different MEAs. Each MEA was offered with both the pre- and post-2009 sequencing, allowing a clear comparison of sequencing methods. Results from this study indicate that on the first revision, the amount of change resulting from TA reviews was indistinguishable from that resulting from peer reviews. However, on the second revision, the amount of change resulting from TA reviews was significantly different (greater) than the change resulting from peer reviews. Overall, the amount of change resulting from feedback was greater when peer reviews were provided first, and TA reviews were provided second.

Additionally, students bring perceptions about their abilities, and have already begun practicing preferred methods of analysis and documentation. Understanding how students with different backgrounds develop problem solving skills in first year engineering programs is of critical importance in order to close achievement gaps between diverse populations. This study examines how students solve engineering problems and identifies variations based on student factors of gender, ethnicity, mathematics preparation and achievement, and prior engineering experience. Solutions for three problems from 27 students were analyzed (n = 68 solutions). Students worked out problems using custom-designed software that digitally records ink strokes and allows researchers to associate codes to the problem solution at any point, even in portions of the problem solution that would not have been available without the use of this technology, such as in erased work. Differences in how students solve problems were assessed based on the prevalence (or absence) of elements and errors in the problem solving process, which were evaluated using task analysis. Results indicated that pre-engineering experience did not have a significant impact on successfully solving problems; however, having completed a calculus course was significantly related to successful problem solving. Future research will expand the study population to a larger sample of first year engineering students across multiple semesters, identifying key strategies that are absent for students with low mathematics preparation, and to investigate relationships between prior academic preparation and indicators of metacognition.", "authors": [{"name": "Sarah J.

Mean differences were conducted in two ways: (1) comparing mean values of the same SRL items, and (2) comparing the level/quality between SRL features for two themes (i.e., knowledge acquisition and problem solving) at the beginning and end of the semester. The findings suggested that there were improvements in some aspects of monitoring and regulating strategies. Comparison of SRL item mean values revealed that there was increasing awareness on specific SRL items.

The method is designed to facilitate students paths to discovery of key concepts that are often misinterpreted or not readily mastered. This is accomplished by facilitating students timely discovery of the underlying fundamentals through physical or virtual interaction with Statics and Dynamics challenges. The key difficulty to insuring positive impact on concept mastery is sustaining student engagement throughout the process.

In this paper we explore student motivation using cluster analysis, a quantitative method that has been proven useful in examining group-based motivational profiles within academic settings. We apply a range of clustering techniques to a data set comprising motivational survey responses of undergraduate engineering students at three different colleges. We confirm the outcomes of previous clustering analyses, revealing the existence of different student motivational profiles in academic settings, and we offer several new perspectives on engineering student motivation. First, different cluster analysis methods describe similar trends in motivational profiles, but divergent judgements in the distribution of students into these profiles. Second, examination of longitudinal data illustrates that students' endorsements of the various motivations fluctuate significantly, and sometimes dramatically, within the duration of a single course. This challenges the \"they either have it or they don't\" concept of motivation, and highlights the importance of understanding of students' situational motivational responses to classroom activities.", "authors": [{"name": "Jonathan Stolk", "affiliation": "Franklin W.

There have been quite a few recent research focused on analyzing the collaboration between Industrial Design students and Engineering students. However, little in the literature has been dedicated to discuss the education of Interaction Design and its collaboration with engineering programs. In this research, we tried to identify characteristics that differentiate IXD and EPICS students by focusing on the experiences of the IXD students. Some characteristics made the collaboration successful, but other created frustrations. In order to understand, explore, and evaluate the collaboration process, we collected the data during and after the collaboration and qualitatively analyzed it using a design collaboration model. This analysis identified several interesting features of this interdisciplinary collaboration. The collaboration between two programs benefited both sides and will be conducted regularly.

Among these include a culture that embraces intellectual diversity, better team skills, improved problem solving skills, and better complex thinking skills. Strategies incorporating classroom inversion, active learning, and team projects have demonstrated remarkable gains in retention, intellectual diversity, and general problem solving skills. While well above the national average, continued intellectual growth has stagnated over the past three years and remains below that desired both by industry and by the department. In an effort to improve complex thinking skills the department is adopting a developmental approach modeled by Alverno College which has demonstrated substantial growth in many of the attributes of the Engineer of 2020. As a first step towards reducing this \"Alverno Gap\", the department has adopted a developmental approach which is focused on improved problem solving skills within a team environment. In this paper, we describe the Alverno model, discuss an explicit developmental approach to team skills and processes, and provide some initial insight into using embedded assessment as an integral component of transformative curriculum.", "authors": [{"name": "Stuart Kellogg", "affiliation": "Industrial Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jennifer Karlin", "affiliation": "Industrial Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid City, SD"}], "tags": ["cultural differences", "problem solving skills", "context", "industries", "educational institutions", "problem-solving", "developmental", "accreditation", "engineering education"]}, {"title": "Bologna vs non-Bologna academic outcome in BEng Mechanical Engineering within EHEA", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462529", "abstract": "The arising of European Higher Education Area (EHEA) brought up the implementation of new degrees throughout most of European Universities. In the realm of this upcoming environment, during 2009\u20132010 the School of Design Engineering (ETSID) at Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia in Spain, developed a pioneer experience in the first year of the Bachelor Engineering (BEng) degree in Mechanical Engineering, the guidelines of this innovative experience being defined in accordance with the EHEA approaches. Thus, this pioneer experience co-existed with non-Bologna teaching-learning methodology followed in the rest of groups of this BEng degree. Positive academic outcomes found in this first pioneer group encouraged to extend this experience to the second year of this degree during 2010\u20132011, in order to ease the upcoming full Bologna implementation. In this line, classroom activities were established so that collaborative work was promoted, autonomous tasks were developed and an assessment that took into account both classroom and autonomous activities was implemented. In this paper, we present a statistical analysis of the achieved academic outcomes of the pioneer group in the second year of the BEng degree in Mechanical Engineering, relating them to the rest of non-pioneer groups of the same year and degree.", "authors": [], "tags": ["design engineering", "europe", "mechanical engineering", "educational institutions", "collaborative work", "statistical analysis"]}, {"title": "Analizing students performance in an EHEA BEng Industrial Design Engineering degree", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462530", "abstract": "European Universities have been exposed to major changes in order to implement the so called Bologna process. Many facets have had to be addressed in the teaching-learning system, moving from a teacher-centered model to a student-centered one, where a competence-based structure had to be facilitated, and so that the basic competences related to the integral formation of engineers should be accomplished along specific competences, making possible a professional profile and enabling the graduates to get integrated into the job market. Hence, this change has provided the opportunity to create a more active and dynamic teaching-learning model, with more personalized methods and the integration of new technologies. In the midst of this situation, a case study has been undertaken to analyze the consequences of such change in the academic results of the BEng Industrial Design Engineering degree of the School of Design Engineering ETSID (Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain) along the first course of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) adapted program and those obtained by the corresponding pre-EHEA course at ETSID. This paper aims to become an instrument to monitor the development and effectiveness of the teaching-learning policies adopted, thus contributing to the continuous process of educational improvement at ETSID by comparing various performance and success rates.", "authors": [], "tags": ["autonomous activities", "ehea adaptation", "europe", "monitoring", "physics", "educational institutions", "classroom activities", "design engineering", "formative assessment", "mathematics"]}]
