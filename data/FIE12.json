[{"title": "Work in progress: A machine learning approach for assessment and prediction of teamwork effectiveness in software engineering education", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462205", "abstract": "One of the challenges in effective software engineering (SE) education is the lack of objective assessment methods of how well student teams learn the critically needed teamwork practices, defined as the ability: (i) to learn and effectively apply SE processes in a teamwork setting, and (ii) to work as a team to develop satisfactory software (SW) products. In addition, there are no effective methods for predicting learning effectiveness in order to enable early intervention in the classroom. Most of the current approaches to assess achievement of SE teamwork skills rely solely on qualitative and subjective data taken as surveys at the end of the class and analyzed only with very rudimentary data analysis. In this paper we present a novel approach to address the assessment and prediction of student learning of teamwork effectiveness in software engineering education based on: a) extracting only objective and quantitative student team activity data during their team class project; b) pairing these data with related independent observations and grading of student team effectiveness in SE process and SE product components in order to create \u201ctraining database\u201d and c) applying a machine learning (ML) approach, namely random forest classification (RF), to the above training database in order to create ML models, ranked factors and rules that can both explain (e.g. assess) as well as provide prediction of the student teamwork effectiveness. These student team activity data are being collected in joint and already established (since 2006) SE classes at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Fulda University, Germany (Fulda), from approximately 80 students each year, working in about 15 teams, both local and global (with students from multiple schools).", "authors": [{"name": "Shihong Huang", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, USA"}, {"name": "Kazunori Okada", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Aishwarya Iyer", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Marc Sosnick", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Shenhaochen Zhu", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Rainer Todtenhoefer", "affiliation": "Department of Applied Computer Science, Fulda University of Applied Science, Fulda, Germany\u00a0"}, {"name": "Dragutin Petkovic", "affiliation": "Department of Computer Science, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["educational institutions", "software engineering teamwork", "training", "software", "assessment", "machine learning", "software engineering education", "software engineering", "teamwork"]}, {"title": "Teaching software inspection effectiveness: An active learning exercise", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462206", "abstract": "This paper discusses a novel active learning exercise which teaches students how to perform and assess the effectiveness of formal software inspections. In this exercise, students are responsible for selecting an artifact from their senior capstone design projects. The students then use fault injection to strategically place faults within the artifact that should be caught by the inspection exercise. Based on the needs of the team, students prepare an inspection packet consisting of a set of inspection instructions, applicable checklists, and the inspection artifact. Students then \u201chire\u201d a set of inspectors based on classmates' backgrounds and experiences. The team leader then holds two inspection meetings and reports the results. The results are then used to assess the effectiveness of the inspection. Overall, in analyzing 5 years worth of data from this exercise, it is found that students are capable of selecting appropriate materials for inspection and performing appropriate software inspections. The yield of students is lower than an experienced professional might have and the inspection rates tend to be slightly higher than desired for their experience. However, the yield is related to individual preparation time.

Most institutions assess learning using a score-based grading system. Such systems use multiple individual assignment scores to produce a cumulative final course grade, which may or may not represent what a student has learned. Standards-based grading offers an alternative that addresses the need to directly assess how well students are developing toward meeting the course objectives. The course objectives are the focal point of the grading system, allowing the instructor to assess students on clearly defined objectives throughout the course. The system assesses how well students become proficient in the course objectives over the duration of the course. This study extends the use of standards-based grading at the K-12 level into the realm of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Five STEM courses pilot tested the integration of a standards-based grading system to investigate how it impacts affective and cognitive student behaviors.

In this ongoing mixed-methods investigation, we draw on existing motivation and self-regulated learning theories to examine how undergraduate students at a small private college and a large public university become more self-directed as they progress through the first two years of their engineering programs. Preliminary findings indicate that first-year students at the two institutions report significant differences in their motivations and goal orientations. Students at the small private college express higher intrinsic motivation and learning orientation, and lower external regulation and grade orientation, compared to students at the large public university.

Mind maps consist of words and connections between words, and this visual tool helps illustrate how an individual understands how these words connect together in a field. From an analysis standpoint, mind maps are graphs consisting of nodes connected by edges. In the fall of 2011, students created three mind maps over the duration of a digital system design course, and at each of the three intervals, these mind maps were created with the same 20 terms that were introduced throughout the course. Each student's mind maps were then digitally encoded and analyzed using a modern graph analysis tool called GraphCrunch II. Our results show that a simple analysis of graph density is a poor indicator of learning since this metric does not capture a graph's structure, and it is this structure that reflects meaning and understanding by the learner. Instead, a metric called relative graphlet frequency distance (RGF-distance), which is calculated by comparing a golden mind map (expert created mind map) to each of the students mind maps, is used to analyze each students understanding of how these words relate. Our results show that learner's mind maps decrease in RGF-distance over the period of the course, and this means that the students are building graphs more similar to that of the golden model. We, also, see that the RGF-distance over the set of students compared to their grades on an exam or overall grade in the course has some correlation, meaning that these mind maps relate to grades in terms of the learners understanding of vocabulary, but the correlation is not strong.

Subsequently, a focus group was held to get a better understanding of the students' perception of the relationship between QoS, QoE and online learning tools.

A humanoid robotics workshop is included as a part of the curriculum of \u2018Industrial Robotics\u2019 in the Industrial Engineering. This workshop covers one third of the laboratory practices of this subject. A constructivist view for learning is adopted, whereby robotic technologies are not seen as mere tools, but rather as potential vehicles of new ways of thinking about teaching, learning and education at large. Students, in a constructivist learning environment, are invited to work on experiments and authentic problem-solving; with selective use of available resources according to their own interests, research and learning strategies. The authors, as trainers of this workshop, chose ROBONOVA humanoid robots, among other devices, which attempt to partner technology with ideas of constructivism. The materials used in the workshop offer building parts, sensors thus connecting a robot with the external environment and programming software with a simple graphical interface intended for the creation of robot behavioral movements. The idea is \u201clearning by design\u201d, which is central in the constructivist pedagogy introduced firstly by Resnick. In this workshop we corroborate this idea through the project-based learning approach in robotics.

Workplace stresses can have significant financial impact both on university budgets and the overall economy due to poor decision-making, health issues and accidents resulting from illness. Engineering academics that teach and/or research within higher education institutions have been reported anecdotally to have a high prevalence of stress. The actual (self-perceived) level however has been largely unquantified. The research reported in this paper was conducted to assess self-perceived stress levels and identify the stress factors within a cohort of engineering academics at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ), a small regionally based Australian university renowned for its distance education. The questionnaire was applied using a mix of validated and non-validated survey instruments and incorporated a set of questions previously applied at the University of Adelaide (UoA). Findings from USQ are broadly in line with those independently reported elsewhere for Australia and the UK, with some minor exceptions. In summary the USQ project indicates that engineering academics have higher perceived stress levels than the validated health threshold, with significant variation based on age, academic type (teaching-research), and for staff with English as a second language. The results from both universities also indicated that there are significant stress contributors related to the pressure to obtain grants and to publish and to the (low) resultant levels of recognition from employers for any success.

Identifying misconceptions can provide a basis for improved research-based curriculum development and implementation. The recognition of false beliefs and flawed mental models of these concepts can also contribute to theories of conceptual change. The purpose of this research was to identify misconceptions related to open channel flow. During spring and fall of 2011, out of 91 students from two sections of \u2018Water Resources Engineering\u2019 course, 50 students were interviewed, and 41 students were given a pre/post test. The goal of these open-ended interviews and pre/post-tests was to obtain detailed data on students understanding of open channel flow concepts. Results suggest students have misconceptions relating to the hydraulic and energy grade line (HGL/EGL), flow transitions, and flow profiles. Many students have the correct terms of the HGL and EGL but lack understanding of where the terms re on an open channel flow profile. A large percentage of tested students revealed false beliefs relating to transitions. For example, more than 50 percent of tested students drew a decrease in water depth for a subcritical drop, rather than an increase in depth. Students also had difficult in labeling subcritical, critical, and supercritical places along flow profiles and how water flows over or under different weir structures. Repairing these fundamental misconceptions is essential for students to be able to apply these concepts in diverse situations and learn more advanced topics.", "authors": [{"name": "Jennifer Adam", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Shane Brown", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Bernard Vanwie", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA"}, {"name": "Andrew Easley", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}, {"name": "Devlin Montfort", "affiliation": "Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State University, Pullman, USA\u00a0"}], "tags": ["conceptual change", "educational institutions", "water resources", "misconceptions", "earth", "fluids", "open channel flow", "color", "context", "interviews"]}, {"title": "Development of the science technology engineering and mathematics \u2014 Active listening skills assessment (STEM-ALSA)", "link": "https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/FIE.2012.6462248", "abstract": "The purpose of this investigation was to develop the STEM Active Listening Skills Assessment (STEM-ALSA), a conceptually grounded instrument designed to measure four components of active listening, a key element of communication in an academic setting.

For a start, beyond the traditional multiple-choice and true/false responses, these advanced clickers provide several new question modalities that the traditional button-based clickers do not offer. It can be hypothesized that the rich interactions offered by touch-based devices can enhance student engagement even further than the traditional clickers currently do and contribute towards improvements in student learning. To explore this hypothesis, a study was designed to investigate the difference in concept retention among students who use the traditional versus rich classroom response systems (CRS).

In particular, to gauge the influence of one aspect of instruction, the use of interactive web-based course materials that had been developed for Statics, we administered the Force Concept Inventory at the start of the course, and the Statics Concept Inventory at the end of the course. Correlations and then linear regression were applied to study how conceptual knowledge measured at the end of the course depended on conceptual knowledge measured at the start and the amount of use of the web-based courseware. Usage of the web-based courseware was found to promote conceptual knowledge at the end of the course in a statistically significant way only after accounting for initial knowledge as judged by the different conceptual test administered at the start of the course.

This trend is motivated by the fact that many students are highly accustomed to and knowledgeable about playing electronic and computer games. Computer games share a number of potential characteristics with effective instructional tools and therefore have a great potential for positively affecting learning. Achieving a sense of immersion by the students and interactive collaboration among them are two of the main goals being pursued in exploring new types of educational laboratories as alternatives or complements to traditional hands-on experiments. A scripted scenario for a game-based gear train laboratory exercise was implemented in \u2018ME 358 Mechanisms and Machine Dynamics\u2019, a junior-level course for mechanical engineering majors at Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT). This paper discusses the learning assessment conducted in that implementation. The results are presented for two assessment studies comparing versions of game-based gear train experiments to workbook-based gear train experiments with a \u2018hands-on\u2019 laboratory experience. The results suggest that the students learned the concepts addressed by the laboratory content better in the game-based condition and that they had a realistic understanding and appreciation of the practical advantages of game-based gear train experiments over more traditional learning experiences.

We also discuss the initial phase of our curricular implementation strategy in two disciplinary engineering programs at MSU and transfer programs at LCC.", "authors": [{"name": "Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian", "affiliation": "Michigan State University East Lansing, MI\u00a0"}, {"name": "Jon Sticklen", "affiliation": "Michigan State University East Lansing, MI\u00a0"}, {"name": "Neeraj Buch", "affiliation": "Michigan State University East Lansing, MI\u00a0"}, {"name": "Cindee Dresen", "affiliation": "Corporation for Skilled Workforce, Ann Arbor, MI\u00a0"}, {"name": "Claudia E.

Our first year software engineering students have schedules filled with computer science, mathematics, science and humanities. The lack of any exposure to engineering meant some students, expressing a dislike for software engineering, left the program before they had any exposure to the discipline. To address this issue, we created a one credit Software Engineering Freshman Seminar, which all entering students take in their first term at RIT. This lets us insure student/faculty contact early in the program, as well as providing an opportunity to introduce engineering concepts and practices early in each student's program of study. This paper discusses the seminar's current incarnation. In particular, we focus on those aspects of the course which help students identify with software engineering as a profession. The challenge we face is achieving this goal with students whose technical knowledge and skills are modest. We have settled on an approach that provides experience with teamwork, requirements elicitation, and the effects of change, and addressing professional ethics. These in-class activities are complemented by an assignment to interview a practicing software engineer and to write an interview summary for discussion. This activity ensemble serves to disabuse students of the notion that software engineering is little more than programming, or that the discipline is identical to computer science. Should a student exit the program at this point, at least he or she knows a bit about what they are leaving behind.", "authors": [{"name": "Daniel E.

Ultimately, we aim to understand how students learn in real-world problem solving contexts in order to transfer such learning and such experiences into the engineering classroom. In undergraduate curriculum, well-structured problems with known solutions acquired through preferred solution methods are encountered more frequently than ill-structured problems. The linear process of problem solving teaches students a procedure to be memorized, practiced, and habituated, a process that emphasizes getting answers over making meaning. Real-world problem solving, though, commonly encountered in industry experiences suffused with complex and ill-structured problems, foster cognitive development of essential, problem-based, and globally competitive problem solving skills. Although industry experiences offer many benefits and enable engineering students to begin the practice of solving real-world complex problems, there is limited research on students' learning outcomes and skill gains as a result of participating in such experiences.
